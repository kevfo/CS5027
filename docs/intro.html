<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade, regardless of its mechanical skill.”</p>
<p>– Bush, 1945</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Singapore separated from Malaysia, its focus was put on survival as it was a nation with no natural resources. One such tool that would enable Singapore to survive was through Science: a necessary pre-requisite for industrial and technological advancement.</p>
<p>In February 1966, Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> announced a proposal for forming a new statutory board: the <a href="https://sciencecouncil.org/"><strong>Science Council of Singapore</strong></a>.</p>
<section id="science-council-of-singapore-i.e.-scs" class="level3" data-number="1.1.1">
<h3 data-number="1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="science-council-of-singapore-i.e.-scs"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Science Council of Singapore (i.e., SCS)</h3>
<p>This board was established in 1967 - the board would make reports and suggest recommendations on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Scientific and technological research and developments.</li>
<li>Effective training and utilization of scientific and technological manpower in Singapore.</li>
<li>Establishing official relations with other scientific organizations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1968, the board suggested establishing a science center in Singapore - this was suggested to the Minister of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Shortly after, a special committee was appointed to come up with the preparatory work and submit proposals for setting up the center - this committee included:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A chairman: Ronald Sng Ewe Min</li>
<li>Three members:
<ol type="1">
<li>Sng Yew Chong</li>
<li>Rex Anthony Shelley</li>
<li>Bernard Tan Tiong Gie</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h4 data-number="1.1.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="science-and-industry-quiz-i.e.-siq"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1.1</span> Science and Industry Quiz (i.e., SIQ)</h4>
<p>The SCS thought that one way to popularize science and technology over the television would be to combine education with entertainment.</p>
<p>Secondary school students would form teams and participate in the SIQ. Each team would have four members: two members would participate in the quiz programme and the other two on standby.</p>
<p>There are two rounds to the SIQ:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Preliminary Round</strong></p>
<p>All competing teams had two sets of question papers: Set A and Set B.</p>
<p>Set A had 100 questions; Set B had 50 questions. Each team had 15 minutes to answer both sets.</p>
<p>The first preliminary round was held at the Raffles Institution Hall on 28 July, 1972. 54 Teams competed, but only 12 were selected for the Televised Series.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Televised Series</strong></p>
<p>There were three stages - the four Quarter Finals, two Semi-Finals, and a Final.</p>
<p>Each of the televised series had four rounds. The first round was where each team would have a fixed amount of time to answer as many questions as they could.</p>
<p>The second round consisted of questions being asked to each individual of a team. The question had to be answered within a minute and with no assistance.</p>
<p>Round three posed a question to all team members - the team had to answer the question unanimously. The six questions posed in this round enabled problem-solving and teamwork skills.</p>
<p>The fourth final round was a buzzer-style question triva session.</p></li>

<p>In 1979, the SIQ was replaced by The Innovators.</p>
<p><strong>The Innovators</strong> was a series of six programs where JC<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> students would work with Radio Television Singapura producers to produce television programs that had a scientific or technological theme, but focused on innovation.</p>
<p>The top three programs included:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“…And Life Goes On”</li>
<li>“Food Encounters”</li>
<li>“The Miracle Gene”</li>
</ol>
<p>These three programs were selected by a panel of judges - the student producers were awarded prizes too.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“While formal educational institutions make sure we are raising a nation of “science literate people”, Science Centre Singapore takes this to the next level.</p>
<p>We make science accessible and engaging, creating an environment where Singaporeans are empowered to advance their own learning and, hopefully, are inspired to do something incredible with their futures.</p>
<p>Admission (just to the Science Centre) is $6 for adults and $4 for children.”</p>
<p>– Science Center’s justification</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Science Center aimed to be a place where “Science befriends and transforms the minds of millions”.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Many people whom I have spoken to remember the Science Center fondly, and can even name specific exhibits that have inspired them. The new Science Centre gives us an opportunity to do even more – to help our young learn through play and fun, to inculcate a love and wonder for science and technology among Singaporeans and to kindle a passion for lifelong learning and inquiry.”</p>
<p>– Mr.&nbsp;Koh</p>

<p>The TIMSS gauges the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth and eighth graders (i.e., primary four and secondary 2 respectively). However, some countries only participate at the eighth-grade level.</p>
<p>The TIMSS allows for an international benchmark in three bands and along two dimensions - content and cognitive domains:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Average is higher than the US’</li>
<li>Average score is not measurably different from the US’</li>
<li>Average score is lower than the US’</li>
</ol>
<p>Results may wildly differ between countries, but the reasons are attributed to students’ attitudes, educational aspirations, school climates (e.g., violence in schools), school resources, and safety.</p>

<li><p><strong>Explain and Predict</strong></p>
<p>Scientists use observations to construct explanations for them.</p>

<li><p><strong>Identify and Avoid Bias</strong></p>
<p>Scientific evidence can be biased in how scientists choose to report those facts (or the kind of data collected to begin with).</p>
<p>A scientist’s nationality, sex, age, and other factors may cause them to look for one kind of evidence or interpretation.</p>
<p>A possible safeguard against this is to have many different people involved working on the same problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Realize that nobody is omniscient (i.e., all-knowing)</strong></p>
<p>No scientist had the right to decide for themselves what is “true”.</p>
<p>Scientist whose observations do not align with mainstream ideas may encounter vigorous criticisms - these scientists may also have difficulty garnering support for their research.</p></li>

<p>For scientists and engineers, the value of mathematics lie in its ability to solve problems that originate in the world of experience</p>
<p>Mathematics also find application in “non-technical”, fields, e.g., business, music, politics, sports, and social sciences</p>

<p>Technology extends our abilities to change the world: to cut, shape, or put together materials; to reach farther with our hands, voices, and senses.</p>
<p>We use technology to try to change the world to suite us better The changes may relate to survival needs such as food, shelter, or defense, or they may relate to human aspirations such as knowledge, art, or control.</p>
<p>But the results of changing the world are often complicated and unpredictable.</p>
<p>They can include unexpected benefits, costs, or risks.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-it-practical"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1</span> Is it Practical?</h3>
<p>Engineering combines scientific enquiry and practical values In its broadest sense, engineering consists of construing a problem and designing a solution for it.</p>
<p>Engineering shares many characteristics with science, but engineering affects the social system and culture more directly than scientific research.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.5.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="there-is-no-perfect-design"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1.1</span> There is No Perfect Design</h4>
<p>There is no perfect design as accommodating one constraint leads to conflict with another.</p>
<p>All technologies involve control, e.g., in an iron (or an air-conditioned room, or a rice cooker), the temperature is controlled within a preset range.</p>
<p>Control typically requires feedback, logical comparisons, and a means for activating change</p>

<h4 data-number="1.5.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="side-effects"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.1.2</span> Side Effects</h4>
<p>Technologies have side effects  what is one side effect of X-ray? personal computers? mobile phones? the Internet? photocopy machines? the automobile? social media?</p>
<p>Systematic risk analysis is used to minimise the impact of side effects (e.g., the side effect of X-ray is cancer)</p>
<p>There may also be unintended benefits / consequences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Suntan lotion</strong></p>
<p>The main ingredient, titanium dioxide, mixed with water, results in hydrogen peroxide. This kills phytoplankton that nourishes fish and ultimately poisons the rest of the food chain.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Technology can also fail too (e.g., crashing of the space shuttle).</p>

<p>Issues have also emerged  overuse of fossil fuels, pollution, global warming, new bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics, digital divide, deforestation, extinction of plants and animals, strain on the soil and water systems, and more.</p>

<h4 data-number="1.5.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pseudoscience"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2.1</span> Pseudoscience</h4>
<p>In prescientific times, any attempt to harness nature mean forcing nature against her will, Nature had to be subjugated, usually with some form of magic, or by means that were “above” nature – that is, supernatural.</p>
<p>Science does the exact opposite, it works “within” nature’s laws. The methods of science have largely displaced reliance on the supernatural.</p>
<p>The old ways persist, full force in primitive cultures, and they survive in technologically advanced societies too, usually disguised as science.</p>

<h5 data-number="1.5.2.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-science-column"><span class="header-section-number">1.5.2.1.1</span> No Science! Column</h5>
<p>In his book, Flim-Flam!, James Randi reported that more than 20,000 practising astrologers in the United States serve millions of credulous believers.</p>
<p>Science writer Martin Gardner reports that a greater percentage of Americans today believe in astrology and occult phenomena than did citizens of medieval Europe.</p>
<p>Few newspapers print a daily science column, but nearly all provide daily horoscopes.</p>

<p>Denialism refers to “the employment of rhetorical arguments to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists”.</p>
