    "text": "1.1 Singapore’s Past\n\n“A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade, regardless of its mechanical skill.”\n– Bush, 1945\n\nWhen Singapore separated from Malaysia, its focus was put on survival as it was a nation with no natural resources. One such tool that would enable Singapore to survive was through Science: a necessary pre-requisite for industrial and technological advancement.\nIn February 1966, Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye1 announced a proposal for forming a new statutory board: the Science Council of Singapore.\n\n1.1.1 Science Council of Singapore (i.e., SCS)\nThis board was established in 1967 - the board would make reports and suggest recommendations on:\n\nScientific and technological research and developments.\nEffective training and utilization of scientific and technological manpower in Singapore.\nEstablishing official relations with other scientific organizations.\n\nIn 1968, the board suggested establishing a science center in Singapore - this was suggested to the Minister of Science and Technology.\nShortly after, a special committee was appointed to come up with the preparatory work and submit proposals for setting up the center - this committee included:\n\nA chairman: Ronald Sng Ewe Min\nThree members:\n\nSng Yew Chong\nRex Anthony Shelley\nBernard Tan Tiong Gie\n\n\n\n1.1.1.1 Science and Industry Quiz (i.e., SIQ)\nThe SCS thought that one way to popularize science and technology over the television would be to combine education with entertainment.\nSecondary school students would form teams and participate in the SIQ. Each team would have four members: two members would participate in the quiz programme and the other two on standby.\nThere are two rounds to the SIQ:\n\nPreliminary Round\nAll competing teams had two sets of question papers: Set A and Set B.\nSet A had 100 questions; Set B had 50 questions. Each team had 15 minutes to answer both sets.\nThe first preliminary round was held at the Raffles Institution Hall on 28 July, 1972. 54 Teams competed, but only 12 were selected for the Televised Series.\nTelevised Series\nThere were three stages - the four Quarter Finals, two Semi-Finals, and a Final.\nEach of the televised series had four rounds. The first round was where each team would have a fixed amount of time to answer as many questions as they could.\nThe second round consisted of questions being asked to each individual of a team. The question had to be answered within a minute and with no assistance.\nRound three posed a question to all team members - the team had to answer the question unanimously. The six questions posed in this round enabled problem-solving and teamwork skills.\nThe fourth final round was a buzzer-style question triva session.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.2 The Innovators\nIn 1979, the SIQ was replaced by The Innovators.\nThe Innovators was a series of six programs where JC2 students would work with Radio Television Singapura producers to produce television programs that had a scientific or technological theme, but focused on innovation.\nThe top three programs included:\n\n“…And Life Goes On”\n“Food Encounters”\n“The Miracle Gene”\n\nThese three programs were selected by a panel of judges - the student producers were awarded prizes too.\n\n\n1.1.1.3 Opening of the Science Center\n\n“While formal educational institutions make sure we are raising a nation of “science literate people”, Science Centre Singapore takes this to the next level.\nWe make science accessible and engaging, creating an environment where Singaporeans are empowered to advance their own learning and, hopefully, are inspired to do something incredible with their futures.\nAdmission (just to the Science Centre) is $6 for adults and $4 for children.”\n– Science Center’s justification\n\nThe Science Center aimed to be a place where “Science befriends and transforms the minds of millions”.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to Singapore’s Science Center\n\n\n\n\nIt also aimed to promote interest, learning, and creativity in science and technology via imaginative and enjoyable experiences (that contribute to Singapore’s human resources).\n\n1.1.1.3.1 Redeveloping the Science Center\n\n“Many people whom I have spoken to remember the Science Center fondly, and can even name specific exhibits that have inspired them. The new Science Centre gives us an opportunity to do even more – to help our young learn through play and fun, to inculcate a love and wonder for science and technology among Singaporeans and to kindle a passion for lifelong learning and inquiry.”\n– Mr. Koh\n\nThe above was mentioned by Koh Boon Hwee during 12 November, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 National Science and Technology Board (i.e., NSTB)\nThis was formed in October 1990 (after the passing of the bill); and the enactment of the Science and Technology Board act the following month.\nThe NSTB was a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade & Industry (i.e., MTI).\nThe NSTB developed Singapore into a center of excellence in certain fields of science and technology to enhance national competitiveness in industrial and service sectors (i.e., industry-driven research and development).\n\n1.1.2.1 A*STAR\nOn 5 January 2002, the NSTB was reorganized and renamed to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (i.e., A*STAR).\n\n\n\n\n\nA*STAR’s Homepage\n\n\n\n\nA*STAR aimed to promote mission-oriented research that advances scientific discovery and technological innovations.\nThe agency got a portion of the national science and technology’s budget as a show of support. Its facilities are currently located at Biopolis and Fusionopolis (at one-north).\n\n1.1.2.1.1 A*STAR’s Mission\nA*STAR aims to develop Singapore’s science, technology, and engineering capabilities to boost Singapore’s economic growth via the three ways:\n\nDeveloping the manpower required for the science and technology sectors.\nPioneering research and development to drive innovation and enhance the Singapore’s knowledge-based economy.\nMonetizing results in research and development.\n\nRegarding the final point, A*STAR’s commercialization arm manages its intellectual property and also helps apply its research to industry.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (i.e., LKCNHM)\nThe LKCNHM - formerly known as the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (i.e., RMBR) - was opened on 18 April, 2015 by Dr. Tony Tan Keng Yun: the president and chancellor of the National University of Singapore.\nThe museum strives to be a leader in Southeast Asian biodiversity in research, education, and outreach.\nMrs. Della Lee3 donated enough money to enable LKCNHM to purchase three dinosaur skeletons.\n\n\n1.1.4 NUS High School of Mathematics and Science\nThe school’s mission was to shape the future of education in mathematics and science by producing future-ready pioneers, humanitarians, and innovators for the world.\nThe school’s motto is: Experiment. Explore. Excel.\n\n\n1.1.5 Singapore National Academy of Sciences (i.e., SNAS)\nIn 31 July, 1967, scientists collectively formed the SNAS - a scholarly and professional body. The SNAS was meant to become the equivalent of the UK’s Royal Society or the USA’s National Academy of Sciences.\nThe SNAS was formed with the following objectives:\n\nPromoting the advancement of science and technology in Singapore\nDiscussing scientific, technological, and macroeconomic problems (especially those that concern the nation)\nRepresenting members’ scientific opinions and fellows of the academy"

    "text": "1.2 Singapore’s Return on Investment\nThis sub-section discusses some of Singapore’s results with regards to its investment in science and technology.\n\n1.2.1 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (i.e., TIMSS)\nThe TIMSS is developed and executed at the international level by the International Association for the Evaluation of Education Assessment (i.e., IEA).\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s TIMSS Results in Science\n\n\n\n\nThe TIMSS happens once every four years (the latest one was in 2019) - Singapore has partook in every study.\n\n1.2.1.1 Scope of the TIMSS\nThe TIMSS gauges the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth and eighth graders (i.e., primary four and secondary 2 respectively). However, some countries only participate at the eighth-grade level.\nThe TIMSS allows for an international benchmark in three bands and along two dimensions - content and cognitive domains:\n\nAverage is higher than the US’\nAverage score is not measurably different from the US’\nAverage score is lower than the US’\n\nResults may wildly differ between countries, but the reasons are attributed to students’ attitudes, educational aspirations, school climates (e.g., violence in schools), school resources, and safety.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Programme for International Student Assessment (e.g., PISA)\nThe PISA is a study done once every three years and is run by the Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (i.e., OECD).\nSingapore’s 15-year olds were ranked first in mathematics, science, and reading in 2015 (i.e., Singaporean students were the best in the world when it comes to working in teams to solve problems).\nHence, Singaporean students are very well equipped for the future’s opportunities and challenges - they have a high ability to work well independently and together.\nIn 2018, Singapore came in second place in all three categories (China took first place).\n\n\n1.2.3 Times Higher Education (i.e., THE) University Rankings\nIn 2019, NTU and NUS were ranked 51 and 23 on the THE world university rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS Rankings for NTU and NUS in 2019\n\n\n\n\nThe Quacquarelli Symonds (i.e., QS) rankings ranked NTU and NUS at 12 and 11 respectively - SMU was ranked at 500. Both NTU and NUS were ranked at 11 in the QS rankings in 2020 - SMU was at 477.\n\n\n1.2.4 President’s Science and Technology Award (i.e., PSTA)\nThe PSTA recognizes individuals with creative ideas who have made significant contributions to Singapore.\nSo far, over 60 men and women who have been singled out for this.\n\n\n1.2.5 International Olympiads\nThis following sub sub-section lists Singapore’s performances in the International Olympiads:\n\nMath\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Math Olympiad (i.e., IMO)\n\n\n\n\nThe first math olympiad (i.e., IMO) was held in 1959 in Romania with 7 countries’ participants. Over the years, 100 counries from five continents have participated.\nThe competition is overseen by the IMO board - they also ensure that each host country upholds the traditions of the IMO.\nInformatics\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Olympiads in Informatics (i.e, IOI)\n\n\n\n\nThe IOI is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students - the first IOI happened in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria.\nThe contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving in algorithms.\nBiology\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Biology Olympiad (i.e., IBO)\n\n\n\n\nThe IBO is a competition that tackles Biological problems and deals with Biological experiments (i.e., testing them). The IBO challenges and stimulates participants to expand their talents and to promote participants’ careers as scientists.\nChemistry\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the 30th International Chemistry Olympiad (i.e., IChO)\n\n\n\n\nThe IChO is an annual Chemistry for a nation’s most talented high-schoolers. Nations send a team of four students who are tested on their Chemistry knowledge and skills in a five-hour laboratory practical and five-hour written theoretical examination that are both held on different days.\nYoung Physicists’ Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Young Physicists’ Tournament (i.e., IYPT)\n\n\n\n\nThe IYPT (sometimes called the “Physics World Cup”) is a team-oriented competition for secondary school students.\nParticipants present their solutions to scientific problems they have prepared over several months and then discuss their solutions with other teams.\nAstronomy and Astrophysics (i.e., IOAA)\nThe IOAA promotes interest in astronomy and similar subjects by developing “international contacts” between different schools to promote Astronomy and Astrophysics in schools.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Singapore’s Scientific Pioneers\n\n\n\n\n\nA Book on Singapore’s Scientific Pioneers\n\n\n\n\nThe book shown above contains information on 25 individuals who laid foundations for Singapore’s scientific achievements.\nAll of these scientists were born prior to Singapore’s independence, but have made exceptional contributions to Singapore’s engineering, medical, educational, and scientific sectors.\nSome of these people include:\n\nBenjamin Henry Sheares\nHe was the father of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Singapore. He has a procedure named after him and was one of the top graduates of the King Edward VII College of Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shears Bridge in Singapore\n\n\n\n\nHe was also Singapore’s second president - he also has a bridge named after him: the Benjamin Sheares Bridge (which is one of Singapore’s most famous landmarks).\nShih Choong Fong\nShih was the president of NUS from 2000 to 2008 and also the founding president for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (i.e., KAUST) in from 2008 to 2013.\nShih got a PhD from Harvard in 1973 and led the Fracture Research Group at the GE Corporate Research Lab in the US. In 1981, he joined Brown University. He was appointed University Professor by NUS in 2013 and was inducted into the Honorary Membership by NUSS in 2001.\nTay Eng Soon\nSoon was more well-known as a politician. He was a minister of state in the Ministry of Education from 1980 until he died in 1993.\nSoon worked hard to develop polytechnics and ITEs.\nHis speciality was in nuclear energy and nuclear power."

    "section": "1.3 What is Science?",
    "text": "1.3 What is Science?\n\n“Science is a voyage of intellectual exploration, and an expression of the human spirit.”\n– Henry Stommel, 1989\n\nIn 1834, William Whewell4 (1794 - 1866) coined the term “scientist”5.\nHe was also the master of of Trinity College at Cambridge; he was also a founding member and a president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n1.3.1 Scientific Worldview\nThe world is seen as such by a scientist:\n\nThe world is understandable\nScientific ideas can change\nScientific knowledge is everlasting\nScience cannot answer everything\nScience is an enterprise\n\nScience is a blend of logic and imagination - logic is used to understand why things happen while one’s creativity is used to recognize the meaning of something unexpected.\n\n1.3.1.1 The World is Understandable\nStuff that happens in this world have a consistent pattern that can be seen through close observation.\nBy using one’s intellect along with instruments, people can find all sorts of patterns.\nThe universe is a system where the basic rules are the same.\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Scientific Ideas can Change\nNew observations can challenge existing theories, in which case, new theories may be needed to explain the observation.\nScience is humanity’s attempt at explaining how the universe works.\nTesting, improving, and discarding theories is an ongoing process in Science.\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Scientific Knowledge is Everlasting\nModifying ideas (instead of rejecting them) is a norm in science. Powerful constructs survive and grow more precise so that they are more widely accepted.\nEinstein did not reject the Newtonian law of motion, but only showed them to be a limited application with a more general concept.\n\n\n1.3.1.4 Science Cannot Answer Everything\nMany beliefs fall into this category (e.g., supernatural forces, true purpose of life, etc).\nIn some cases, science may even be seen as irrelevant by people hwo have certain beliefs (e.g., fortune tellers)\n\n\n1.3.1.5 Science is an Enterprise\nScience is a complex, social activity that involves many individuals of many backgrounds.\nScientific research is also competitive in that researchers compete for funding - committees meet up to decide which topic(s) should be focused on.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Components of Science\nScience has certain elements:\n\n1.3.2.1 Scientific Enquiry\nScience demands evidence; scientists focus on collecting accurate data (which are verified by others).\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Making Observations\nTo make observations, scientists must use:\n\nTheir five senses\nInstruments that enhance those senses\nInstruments that go beyond the human senses\n\n\n\n1.3.2.3 Attitudes\nScientists need to be willing to work hard, to have courage, and to embrace openness (i.e., be willing to change).\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Ways of Observation\nScientists…\n\nObserve passively (i.e., watch things happen without interefering)\nMake collections (i.e., collecting samples)\nActively probe the world (e.g., conducting clinical trials, etc).\n\nOtherwise, they also…\n\nExplain and Predict\nScientists use observations to construct explanations for them.\nThese hypotheses should also fit additional observations.\nIdentify and Avoid Bias\nScientific evidence can be biased in how scientists choose to report those facts (or the kind of data collected to begin with).\nA scientist’s nationality, sex, age, and other factors may cause them to look for one kind of evidence or interpretation.\nA possible safeguard against this is to have many different people involved working on the same problem.\nRealize that nobody is omniscient (i.e., all-knowing)\nNo scientist had the right to decide for themselves what is “true”.\nScientist whose observations do not align with mainstream ideas may encounter vigorous criticisms - these scientists may also have difficulty garnering support for their research.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Creative-Failure Methodology\n\n“A basic truth that the history of the creation of the transistor reveals is that the foundations of transistor electronics were created by making errors and following hunches that failed to give what was expected.”\n– William Shockley\n\nWilliam Shockley - inventor of the transistor - started with a concept of the tubeless radio and used trial and error to make his invention.\n\n\n1.3.5 Communication and Organization in Science\nScience can be communicated in a variety of ways, some of which include:\n\nCommunicating with the Public\nScience is too important for the public to stay in the lab.\nMany scientists too feel a need to inform the public about potentially dangerous misconceptions or to counter misinformation from numerous quarters.\n\nScience is also organized into content disciplines - it is a collection of scientific fields (that provide a foundation of research).\nDifferent fields in science also spill into one another (e.g., Biochemistry, Biophysics, etc).\n\n\n1.3.6 A “Right” Way to Perform Science\nThere are ethical principles to conducting science - competition has led to unethical practices such as:\n\nScientists withholding information and falsifying findings\nThese violations damage science, the scientific community, and the funding agencies.\nTreating live subjects\nFor instance, human subjects should only be used for a study if they consent to it. Part of this also means disclosing the risks and intended benefits of research.\nScientists as Experts and Advisors\nScientists partake in public affairs as specialists and as citizens.\nScientists help the public and its representatives to help understand what most likely happened.\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Why is Science so Important?\nScience is so important (and specialised) that the President of the United States has a 25-member panel, known as the “National Science Board” to serve as advisors to him and the Congress on policy matters related to science and engineering, and education in both fields.\nThe National Science Board has its members drawn from industry and academia. Vannevar Bush was the first Presidential Science Advisor, and also head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). He oversaw most of America’s scientific research during World War II.\n\n\n1.3.8 Science in Courtrooms\nAn increasing number of legal disputes involve the principles and tools of science. Properly resolving those disputes matters not just to the litigants, but also to the general public – those who live in our technologically complex society and whom the law must serve.\nThe decisions of the judges should reflect a proper scientific and technical understanding so that the law can respond to the needs of the public"

    "text": "1.5 Technology\nTechnology extends our abilities to change the world: to cut, shape, or put together materials; to reach farther with our hands, voices, and senses.\nWe use technology to try to change the world to suite us better The changes may relate to survival needs such as food, shelter, or defense, or they may relate to human aspirations such as knowledge, art, or control.\nBut the results of changing the world are often complicated and unpredictable.\nThey can include unexpected benefits, costs, or risks.\n\n1.5.1 Is it Practical?\nEngineering combines scientific enquiry and practical values In its broadest sense, engineering consists of construing a problem and designing a solution for it.\nEngineering shares many characteristics with science, but engineering affects the social system and culture more directly than scientific research.\n\n1.5.1.1 There is No Perfect Design\nThere is no perfect design as accommodating one constraint leads to conflict with another.\nAll technologies involve control, e.g., in an iron (or an air-conditioned room, or a rice cooker), the temperature is controlled within a preset range.\nControl typically requires feedback, logical comparisons, and a means for activating change\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Side Effects\nTechnologies have side effects  what is one side effect of X-ray? personal computers? mobile phones? the Internet? photocopy machines? the automobile? social media?\nSystematic risk analysis is used to minimise the impact of side effects (e.g., the side effect of X-ray is cancer)\nThere may also be unintended benefits / consequences:\n\nSuntan lotion\nThe main ingredient, titanium dioxide, mixed with water, results in hydrogen peroxide. This kills phytoplankton that nourishes fish and ultimately poisons the rest of the food chain.\n\nTechnology can also fail too (e.g., crashing of the space shuttle).\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Issues in Technology\nIssues have also emerged  overuse of fossil fuels, pollution, global warming, new bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics, digital divide, deforestation, extinction of plants and animals, strain on the soil and water systems, and more.\n\n1.5.2.1 Pseudoscience\nIn prescientific times, any attempt to harness nature mean forcing nature against her will, Nature had to be subjugated, usually with some form of magic, or by means that were “above” nature – that is, supernatural.\nScience does the exact opposite, it works “within” nature’s laws. The methods of science have largely displaced reliance on the supernatural.\nThe old ways persist, full force in primitive cultures, and they survive in technologically advanced societies too, usually disguised as science.\n\n1.5.2.1.1 No Science! Column\nIn his book, Flim-Flam!, James Randi reported that more than 20,000 practising astrologers in the United States serve millions of credulous believers.\nScience writer Martin Gardner reports that a greater percentage of Americans today believe in astrology and occult phenomena than did citizens of medieval Europe.\nFew newspapers print a daily science column, but nearly all provide daily horoscopes.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.2 Science Denialism\n\nDenialism refers to “the employment of rhetorical arguments to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists”.\n– CS5027 Course Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Consequence of Thabo Mbeki’s Science Denialism\n\n\n\n\nThabo Mbeki’s (the second president of South Africa) denial of science has led to the deaths of many people."

A scientist is used to represent a particular kind of research1.\n\n2.1.1 Bohr’s Quadrant\nResearch here is done for the sake of discovery (i.e., for knowledge purposes).\nThere is no attention to the research’s practicality\n\n\n2.1.2 Edison’s Quadrant\n\n“Edison never allowed himself or those working with him in Menlo Park five minutes to consider the underlying side of the significance of what they were discovering in their headlong rush toward commercial illumination.\nThe value and even the mark of true science consists, in my opinion, in the useful inventions which can be derived from it.”\n– Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n\nResearch in this quadrant is done for the sake of applications. When Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, he wasn’t interested in the science behind the device, but the potential applications and revenue that could be generated from the light bulb.\n\n\n2.1.3 Pasteur’s Quadrant\nThis quadrant was a mix of both Bohr’s and Edison’s quadrants: research in this quadrant was a mix of both practical applications and discovering new knowledge.\nPasteur not only studied the disease that was ruining southern France’s silkworm industry, but also anthrax, rabies, and fermentation and brewing in the beer industry."

    "section": "2.3 Types of Innovation",
    "text": "2.3 Types of Innovation\n\n“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”\n– Steve Jobs\n\n\n“Leave the beaten track occasionally and dive into the woods. Every time you do so you will be certain to find something that you have never seen before.”\n– Bell Labs’ Motto\n\nAn innovation is a series of activities that begin when an idea is conceived. This idea then undergoes a series of research, development, engineering, design, market analysis, management decision making, and so on before ending at product realization.\nInnovations are like creations and exploitations of new flowers.\n\n“Innovations, like flowers, start from tiny seeds and have to be nurtured carefully until they blossom, then their essence has to be carried elsewhere for the flowers to spread.\nInnovations can grow wild, springing up weed-like despite unfavourable circumstances.\nAnd some conditions - soil, climate, fertilizer, the layout of the garden - produce larger and more abundant flowers.”\n– Professor himself\n\nInnovations can be broadly divided into several categories:\n\nProduct Innovations\nThis is the introduction of a good or a service that is new or is significantly improved in some way (i.e., technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness, or other functional characteristics).\nSuch innovations can be based on new ideas and technologies (or a combination of existing and new ideas and technologies).\nProcess Innovations\nThese are the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method (which often includes changes in techniques, equipment, and / or software).\nSuch innovations are often made to decrease unit costs, to increase quality, or to produce or deliver significantly improved products.\nThese innovations also deal with the steps in making a product.\nService Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nService Kiosks at McDonalds’\n\n\n\n\nThese are intangible methods of serving users at a new level of performance - for instance, new service concepts.\nRadical Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP3 Logo\n\n\n\n\nThese are big and major changes in products.\nThe MP3 audio system is one major example. Prior to the invention of MP3, music was listened to communally.\nIncremental Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition from Mentos Mint Candy to Mentos Caramels\n\n\n\n\nThese apply existing knowledge to improve products.\n\n\n2.3.1 Innovation as Work\nInnovation is the work of knowing, not doing. It’s also an effort to purposeful, forced change in an enterprise’s economic or social position.\n\n“I am not pleading with you to make changes. I am telling you you have got to make them – not because I say so, but because old Father Time will take care of you if you don’t change. Advancing waves of other people’s progress sweep over the unchanging man and wash him out. Consequently, you need to organise a department of systematic change-making.”\n– Charles F. Kettering\n\nInnovation requires knowledge, ingenuity, and boldness. If a person lacks persistence and commitment, then talent, knowledge, and ingenuity will not be useful.\n\n“Businessmen go down with their businesses because they like the old way so well they cannot bring themselves to change. One sees them all about - men who do not know that yesterday is past, and who woke up this morning with their last year’s ideas.”\n– Henry Ford\n\nInnovation is a specific function of entrepreneurship, whether that be in the form of an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by an individual.\n\n\n2.3.2 Characteristics of Innovation\nKanter (1998) suggested the following traits of most, if not all innovations:\n\nUncertainty\nSources of innovation may be unpredictable - the goal of innovation may have little to base itself off of.\nInnovations make progress in spurts in unforseen moments.\nA Long Journey\nThe costs of innovation may overrun and the results are highly uncertain.\nAnalysts have estimated that it may take years for a business to see any returns on their innovations.\nKnowledge-Intensive\nThe innovation process generates new knowledge and in doing so, uses human intelligence and creativity. This learning curve is steep.\nEfforts during innovation are vulnerable to leaving because of the loss of knowledge and experience (i.e.,\nControversial\nInnovations are always competitive - they provide an alternative course of action.\nOn several occassions, an innovation may be a threat to peoples’ interests (whether that “interest” be a salesperson receiving high commissions or whatnot).\nPolitical problems are often the primary cause for the failure of new venture departments in corporations.\nImperialistic\nAn innovation is also capable of crossing boundaries.\nThere is also evidence that the best ideas or interdisciplinary (i.e., they benefit from broader perspectives and from information outside of the idea responsible for the innovation).\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Example #1: Scrabble\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Playing Scrabble\n\n\n\n\nIn 1931, Alfred Mosher Butts was a young, out-of-work architect who was seeking a means of making money.\nButts was interested in anagrams and crossword puzzles (i.e., his source of inspiration) - after further analysis, he found that games of his generation fell into one of three categories:\n\nNumber-based games\nMove-based games\nWord-based games\n\nHe eventually created a game that used a grid and words. Butts wanted his game to have both skill and luck (with a stronger emphasis on skill). Butts also realized that of the 26 characters in the alphabet, that not all of them were used frequently.\nTo find out the relative frequencies, he painstakingly studied the front pages of the New York Times, doing letter-by-letter counts (i.e., innovation is knowledge-intensive).\nThis enabled Butts to assign values to each letter in his game.\nFrom 1932 to 1938, Butts made the sets by hand and gave them to friends; most game manufacturers in the US turned down Butts’ idea.\nIn 1943, Butts met marketing genius James Brunot - Brunot made some refinements to Butts’ game.\nEventually, Brunot and his wife made an agreement with Selchow & Righter, a much more established game manufacturer to make the game (as Brunot could not keep up with game production himself).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Irish Scrabble Association\n\n\n\n\nBy 1954, more than 4 million sets of the game had been sold; the game was also available in other languages (e.g., Spanish, Italian, French, etc).\nIn 1972, Selchow & Righter purchased the game and trademarked “Scrabble”.\nHasbro now supports the National Scrabble Association (It was formerly Coleco, but they went bankrupt).\n\n\n2.3.4 Example #2: Barbie Dolls\n\n\n\n\n\nA Barbie Doll Holding a Plastic Video Recorder\n\n\n\n\nIn 1956, American businesswoman Ruth Handler was vacationing in Switzerland until she came across Bild Lilli: a prostitute doll with long legs and heavy makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bild Lilli Doll\n\n\n\n\nThe first barbie doll came out in 1959."

Fry thought that Silver’s adhesive would be the ticket for a better bookmark.\nFry went to work the next day, ordered a sample of the adhesive and began coating it on paper, carefully coating only the edge of the paper so that the part protruding from his hymnal wouldn’t be sticky. Fry also realized that the bookmark could also be a note.\nIn 1978, 3Mers descended on Boise, Idaho, with samples for what would later be called the “Boise Blitz”. Boise was selected because it wasn’t too big a city.\nSamples were handed out, and 3M discovered that more than 90% of the people who tried them would buy them.\nAt the request of 3M marketers, Shirley Tholander (secretary to Lew Lehr, chairman of the 3M board) sent a letter to her executive secretary peers at Fortune 100 companies and enclosed a product sample.\nIncongruities\nAn Incongruity is an incompability - something that appears very different to the point of change.\nIn 1912, Charles Franklin Kettering invented the electric starter.\nBefore the electric starter, this boost was provided by a crank at the front of the car. Women and men of smaller stature had trouble working the crank without help. In addition, the crank was dangerous to operate, and some drivers were injured while cranking the car – this became a source of innovation.\nThe impetus for the electric starter came from a realisation of the incongruity between the demographics of car buyers versus the demographic composition of the world at large.\nWithout an easy way to start the car, car manufacturers were only selling to half2 the population!\nProcess Needs\nSBS Transit’s Iris NextBus and PostBox are good examples.\nIndustry Market and Structures\nIndustry structures can change, creating tremendous opportunities for innovation.\nIn the past, photographic film needed to be “processed” in a dark room.\nIn the digital world, processing can be self-serviced.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Outside a Company\nThese include:\n\nDemographic Changes\nThe graying of many societies is a demographic change that is looming.\nOne impact of this will be the increasing need for robots to do routine housework (and so on).\nChanges in Public Perception\nCirque du Soleil (i.e., CdS) capitalised on the changes in public perception on the use of animals in circuses (in addition, the cost of the animals and their training, medical care, housing, insurance, and transportation was very high).\nTraditional circus shows have a series of unrelated acts, but each Cirque du Soleil creation has a theme and story line, somewhat resembling a theater performance.\nNew Knowledge and Scientific Discoveries\nThere is a protracted time span between the emergence of new knowledge and its distillation into usable technology.\nThen there is another long period before this new technology appears in the marketplace in products, processes or services.\nTo become effective, innovation of this sort demands not one kind of knowledge but"

    "text": "2.5 Innovation Case Study #1: Shipping Containers\n\n\n\n\n\nA Shipping Container\n\n\n\n\nThe shipping container was invented by Malcolm Purcell McLean. MacLean was also responsible for founding pan-Atlantic services.\n\n2.5.1 Prior to the Shipping Container’s Fruition\nArmies of ill-paid and ill-treated workers called longshoremen would help unload and load supplies onto merchant ships. The whole (un)loading process would take a day - shipping costs were hence expensive (i.e., a four-thousand mile voyage for a shipment might consume about 50% of its costs for just two ten-mile movements).\n\n“In the first forty months of World War II, the U-boats sank 2,177 merchant ships totalling 11,045,284 tons, while the number of merchant ships lost to all other causes was negligible in comparison.”\n– Syrett, 1993, page 1.\n\nMany German “U-boats” (i.e., submarines) also sank many merchant ships during the Battle of the Atlantic.\nIn response to this, the US navy built more than 2400 “liberty ships” between 1941 and 1945. These ships were small enough to avoid being sunk so that little cargo would be lost if the ship was sunk.\nAfter the war, the US navy sold about 450 “liberty ships” to their merchant lines. However, these “liberty ships” were cramped and had odd dimensions - longshoremen needed to figure out how to fit cargo in these conditions. These “liberty ships” wasted time and money from the shipowners’ perspectives.\n\n2.5.1.1 More About Longshoremen\n\n\n\n\n\nLongshoremen Loading Bananas onto a Merchant Ship\n\n\n\n\nLongshoremen were individuals who saw themselve as tough, independent men who were doing a tough job. They had reputations as brawlers and drinkers.\nThe work that they did was brutal and physically dangerous, so much so that there were many injuries, and in some cases, fatalities.\nLongshoremen would also work in all sorts of weather conditions and would also compete among themselves for work. This entire process meant kickbacks, flattery, and begging. Because of this, their income was irregular and longshoremen would be loyal to their co-workers, not the company that they were working for.\nStrikes were also frequent due to poor pay and poor working conditions. In Britain alone, these strikes led to 1 million man-days lost between 1948 to 1951 and another 1.3 million in 1954. These strikes also led to two major problems:\n\nPilfering: longshoremen would end up stealing the cargo that they were supposed to load.\nResistance to anything that might eliminate jobs.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 McLean’s Background and Starting His Own Trucking Company\nMacLean was born in Maxton, North Carolina. His mother first taught him how to do business by giving him eggs to sell on commission.\nMcLean graduated from high school in 1931 and started working at a grocery store to stock shelves. He eventually became the manager of a gas station in a nearby town.\nMcLean learned that drivers were being paid $5 an hour just to transport gas to the station.\n\n2.5.2.1 McLean Trucking Company\nIn March 1934, McLean started the McLean Trucking Company. In 1935, he started off with two trucks and a truck trailer. He also employed nine truck drivers who owned their own rigs.\nIn 1940, he owned about 30 trucks and grossed about $230,000.\nIn 1945, he owned 162 trucks and in 1946, made a revenue of about $2.2 million.\nIn 1953, McLean noticed that the highways were becoming increasingly congested. He was also concerned that domestic ship lines were allowed to buy war-surplus cargo ships for a low price from the government.\nIn September 1955, McLean sold off his trucking company for about $14 million!\n\n\n\n2.5.3 McLean’s First Container Ship\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Image of the Ideal-X\n\n\n\n\nOn 26 April, 1956, 58 aluminium truck bodies were loaded aboard an ageing tanker Ideal-X that was moored in Newark, New Jersey. Ideal-X then sailed into Houston.\nOn 1 April, 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority (i.e., PSA) was formed to take over the functions, the assets, and the liabilities of the Singapore harbor board.\n\n2.5.3.1 What is a Shipping Container?\nA shipping container is an aluminum or a steel box that held up by rivets and welds - it has a wooden floor and two enormous doors at both ends.\nThe container cheapened transportation costs; it was also a part of a highly efficient and seamless system for shipping cargo across the world.\nThe container could also be loaded onto the Ideal-X in seven minutes (i.e., using a crane). The railroad and trucking business attempted to compete with McLean’s shipping containers. Between April and December, 44 voyages were created; consequently, the tanker’s capacity increased from 58 to 60 containers (before it increased to 62 containers).\n\n\n\n2.5.4 New York’s Decline\nMcLean’s containers made New York ports obsolete. During the 1920s, the trucking industry had already made New York’s ports obsolete.\nIn 1952, traffic leading to piers was so bad that pier-bound vehicles were banned from the Twelfth Avenue.\n\n\n2.5.5 Social Impact of Shipping Containers\nWhen the industry fled New York, the number of manufacturing jobs fell.\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard closed in 1966, and Brooklyn residents abandoned the borough in droves. Brooklyn’s population fell by 14% between 1971 and 1980."

He was disturbed by what he saw. He thought: “we can put people on the moon and travel to the depths of the ocean, but we cannot get a wheelchair over a curb?”\nThe more he thought about the limitations faced by people in wheelchairs - no eye-level conversations, no trips to the beach or anywhere else without sidewalks, no reaching the top shelf at the grocery, no possibility of defeating the absolute barrier of stairs - the more he became offended as an engineer\n\n2.6.1 Kamen’s Invention\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iBOT Project Started by Kamen\n\n\n\n\nFred-iBOT was a wheelchair that could roll through gravel and sand, go up curbs, and even climb stairs. It would change the lives of many.\nThe project was funded by Johnson & Johnson, but did not take off likely due to cost issues.\n\n\n2.6.2 About Dean Kamen\nHe was born in Rockville Center, Long Island, New York, in 1951. He attended college at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.\nHe also owned a business, Independent Prototype, and did a project for Cordis, a medical company, through which he met the founder, William Murphy. He made about $60,000 a year\nBart, a medical student at Harvard, suggested that he work on a drug-infusion pump.\nFrom there, Kamen started a new company - AutoSyringe - where he designed the first portable insulin pump (which freed diabetics from their condition’s limitations).\n\n2.6.2.1 Starting a Family Business\nKamen’s brother, Mitch and Mitch’s friends became assemblers for the pump.\nHis mother tested circuit boards and kept the books.\nHis father drew the illustrations for the manual.\nHe enlisted the help of Worcester Polytechnic’s students and professors to help him improve the design of his inventions.\nKamen also moved to New Hampshire to evade New York’s high taxes.\nEventually, Kamen would sell the pump to Baxter Healthcare for about $30 million in 1982 (when Kamen was 31 years old).\nKamen would then go onto buy an airplane, a helicopter, and an island in Long Island Sound. He then founded his own R&D company DEKA (i.e., short for DEan KAmen).\nKamen’s first spinoff company Teletrol installed climate control systems for large industrial and commercial buildings\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Kamen’s Attitude Regarding Failure\n\n“In study after study, of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice-skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals,” writes the neurologist Daniel Levitin, “this number comes up again and again.\nTen thousand hours is equivalent to roughly three hours a day, or 20 hours a week, of practice over 10 years …. No one has yet found a case in which true world-class expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.”\n– Dean Kamen\n\nIn 1987, Baxter Healthcare approached Kamen to improve its kidney dialysis machine - it was noisy, expensive, heavy (180 lb) and bulky!\nKamen urged his engineers not to limit themselves to what they thought was feasible, and he did not hold failures against his engineers if they learned something along the way.\nHis philosophy was that no experiments was useless."

This was a problem as not only was it difficult to oversee such a vast amount of workers, but there would also be inconsistencies with the quality of labor.\nA&G then offered a price of $75000 to anybody who could invent an automatic cigarette rolling machine.\n\n2.7.1 James Albert Bonsack\nOn September 4, 1880, Bonsack - a teenager tinkerer - got a patent for his invention. His machine could turn out about 200 to 212 cigarettes per minute (roughly 40 to 50 workers’ output).\n\n2.7.1.1 Bonsack’s Machine’s Performance\nA&G ultimately rejected the machine for the following reasons:\n\nThey feared that cigarettes were traditionally hand-crafted.\nThey feared that the machine would be too efficient, leaving them with mountains of unsold cigarettes.\nOverall managerial timidity associated with the handling of the dismissals of unneeded workers.\n\nWashington Duke and his son, James Buchanan Duke, decided to install Bonsack’s machine in their factories. In 1889, Duke & Sons sold a billion cigarettes, and in 1890, formed the American Tobacco Company,\nThe machines brought about a tremendous reduction in the cost of manufacturing cigarettes.\nBy 1884, the Bonsack Machine was producing from 100,000 to 120,000 cigarettes per day, the equivalent of the production of forty to fifty hand workers.\nDuke, like other producers, initially overcame any popular prejudice against the machines in a very simple way: he used them in the greatest secrecy and the public remained unaware of their widespread application for years.\nThe Duke company began to produce most of its cigarettes by machine in 1885, encountering little of the consumer resistance its rivals had anticipated. Duke’s application of the Bonsack Machines revolutionized the business of making cigarettes; the profits of the Duke company rose during subsequent years.\nThis was also what happened to Leica."

Furious mobs also destroyed 40 customs post in the 18-mile wall surrounding Paris.\nBecause of this, France was bankrupt - the king didn’t know what to do and debts rose in England’s favor.\n\n3.2.1 8 August, 1788\nKing Louis XVI summoned the Estate General - something that hadn’t been done in 175 years (i.e., not since 1614).. The Estate General represents the three general orders of French society: clergy, nobility, and commoners.\nThere only about 500000 clergy and nobility in the Estate General and about 27 million commoners.\nNonetheless, Louis XVI ordered the Estate Geneal to form a cahiers de doléances, a notebook of grievances. One of the items was a reform of weights and measures.\n\n\n3.2.2 Formation of the National Assembly\nOn June 17, 1789, the deputies of the third estate (i.e., the nation) were locked out of the meeting hall at Versailles. They thought that that was Louis XVI’s way of forcing them to disband.\nInstead, the deputies had a meeting at a nearby tennis court - they swore to never disband until France had a written constitution.\n\n\n3.2.3 14 July, 1789\nLouis XVI let his finance minister Jacques Necker go. Necker was sympathetic to the third estate and was hailed as a reformer by the people.\nOn the same day, a large crowd bursted into the Invalides (i.e., old soldiers’ home and weapons depot) and carried 30,000 muskets and fire cannons. They also raided the bastille for gunpowder - by the end, the Invalides was theirs (with about 170 casualties).\n\n\n3.2.4 5 and 6 October, 1789\nA crowd of women (i.e., fishwives, stallkeepers, harlots, and seamstresses) marched towards the Versailles with weapons (e.g., cudgels, scythes, etc.) and demanded bread.\nOn the next morning, they found an open side gate and burst into the palace. With the heads of two guards impaled on a spike, they escorted the royal family to Paris and left them in the Tuileres Palace.\n\n\n3.2.5 21 June , 1791\nLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette slipped out of the Tuileres in servants’ disguise for a 200-mile dash to Austrian territory (that was overseen by Marie’s brother). However, a postmaster identified Louis and the couple was arrested and bought back to Paris. Both people were found guilty of treason.\nOn 21 September, 1792, the monarchy was abolished.\nLouis XVI was beheaded on 21 January, 1793 - his body was dumped in an anonymous grave.\nMarie Antoinette was beheaded on 16 October, 1793; her body was taken to a graveyard behind the Church of Medeline. However, the gravediggers were on a lunch break.\nThis opportunity gave Marie Groscholtz (later known as Madame Tussaud) enough time to make a was figure of her face.\n\n\n3.2.6 France’s Measurement Situation\n\n“Contemporaries estimated that under the cover of some eight hundred names, ancient regime France contained a staggering 250,000 different units of weights and measures.”\n– Alder, 2002, p. 3\n\nMany quantities were named as such because of their origins from human needs and interests.\nThe Greeks and Romans used fingers as a base measurement - a “foot”’s length is about the same as a human foot. The cubit foot was about as long as an arm’s bend at the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Because of this, the following measurements were fashioned:\n\n1 foot = 16 fingers\n1 cubit = 24 fingers\n\nAnthropometric measures also reflected the amount of labor that a person could do in one sitting. Coal was measured in charge and was equivalent to about \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of a miner’s daily output. Arable land was measured in “homme” or “journee” to estimate the amount of land that a peasant might be able to plough in a day."

    "section": "3.3 Implications of the Metric System",
    "text": "3.3 Implications of the Metric System\nThere were many different kinds of implications (to different disciplines) when the metric system was introduced.\n\n3.3.1 Religious Implications\n\n“You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment regarding measures in length, weight, or quantity. You shall have honest balances, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.”\n– Leviticus, 19:35-36\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scientific Implications\nScientists argued that such a system should also proclaim universal measures (just as how the French revolution would also proclaim universal rights for all).\nScientists also derived the fundamental unit from the measure of the word itself.\n\n3.3.2.1 Fundamental Unit\nThe “unit of length” was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance along the meridian through Paris from the North Pole to the Equator.\nThe “meter” would be eternal as it was taken from the Earth itself (which was believed to be eternal). It was also equally belong to all people of the world as the Earth also belonged to each individual equally.\nAn alternative idea was that a fundamental unit of length could also be derived from the length of a pendulum beating one second. This was an idea that dated back to the 17th century when Galileo demonstrated that the period of a pendulum’s beat was determined by its length.\nHowever, the length of a one-second pendulum was also sensitive to the latitude at which it was measured, because gravity varied slightly with latitude. The equator may have been a suitable choice, but it was also quite remote from scientific nations; hence, the second most natural location would be 45\\(^\\circ\\) of north latitude - at the outskirts of Bordeaux in south-west France. However, the idea did not meet with international approval.\n\n3.3.2.1.1 Refinements to the System\nAuguste-Savinien Leblond - a French mathematician - coined the word “meter” (which came from the Greek word “metron”) for the fundamental unit of length.\nGreek prefixes were used for multiple measures of the meter and Latin prefixes for submultiples. This idea was proposed by Claude Antoine Prieur.\nFor a brief period of time, these prefixes scared people, so they were replaced with ordinary names (e.g., “decimeter” would used to be called a palme).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Meridian Expedition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meridian on the Globe\n\n\n\n\nThe meridian is an imaginary north-south line on the Earth’s surface that connects both geographic poles. It is used to indicate longitude.\nIn June 1792, two astronomers - Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre and Pierre-François-André Méchain - went in opposite directions from Paris to measure a piece of the meridian arc that ran from Dunkirk to Barcelona through Paris.\nThey did this to establish a common standard of measure that people of all sorts could use it.\n\n3.3.3.1 Geodesy\nGeodesy is the science of measuring and understanding Earth’s properties - its shape, its gravity, its orientation in space - as well as how these properties change over time.\nVia GPS, many geodesists can measure the movement of a site 24 hours per day, seven days a week.\nGeodesy on a smaller scale is called surveying.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Standard for Mass\nAntoine Lavoisier and the crystallographer René-Just Haüy worked on the grave - the kilogram as it was previously called - as a cubic decimeter of rainwater weighed in a vacuum at the melting point of ice (i.e., 0\\(^\\circ\\)C).\nIn 1799, the chemist Lefèvre-Gineau would define the “gram” as a cubic centimeter of rainwater in a vacuum at the temperature of maximum density.\n\n\n3.3.5 First International Scientific Conference\nTwo months before Méchain and Delambre finished their measurements, foreign representatives arrived in Paris to attend the Congress on Definitive Metric Standards. This happened on 28 November 1798.\nThe instruments used for the preliminary work was inspected and tested in field observations. The representatives were asked to propagate the new system in their own countries.\n\n3.3.5.1 Adopting the Meter\nWhen the meter was introduced in France, it caused confusion. The system disrupted norms and opened local markets to outside competitions. Even physicians were afraid that they would have to re-learn all their dosages.\nNapoleon Bonaparte refused to learn the system - he insisted that the weights he got be restated in poids de marc (i.e., old-style pounds) as he could not “think” in the new units.\nEventually, a legislation passed in 1873 that would mandate the metric system mandatory throughout France and its colones from 1840 onwards.\n\n\n\n3.3.6 World Metrology Day\nThe meter convention was signed on 20 May, 1875 by representatives from the following nations:\n\nArgentina\nAustria\nBelgium\nBrazil\nDenmark\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nPeru\nPortugal\nRussia\nSpain\nSweden and Norway\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUSA\nVenezuela\n\nThis day also mandated the establishment of a permanent International Bureau of Weights and Measures (i.e., BIPM: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to be located in Sèvres, France.\nThis annivesary is now known as World Metrology Day."

    "text": "6.1 What is Biology?\nThe word Biology is derived from the Greek words “bios” (meaning “life”) and “logos” (meaning “study” or “knowledge”). Hence, Biology is the study of living organisms.\nIt also involves many other techniques such as Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics.\nBiology also overlaps with Medicine to a great extent.\n\n6.1.1 Characteristics of Living Organisms\nAll living organisms will share the following characteristics:\n\nMovement\nAll living organisms exhibit some form of movement.\nReproduction\nAll living organisms come from pre-existing generations and can give birth to the following generation.\nReproduction can take many forms (i.e., asexually or sexually). DNA - among many other molecules - are involved in reproduction. DNA contains “instructions” for cellular structures and ultimately, for the whole organism.\nSensing\nAll living organisms will have some sort of response towards stimuli from the outside world.\nThese responses can be slow or fast.\nRespiration\nEverything that an organism does is governed by chemical processes (that consume energy). The energy to do work often comes in sugars, amino acids, and other biochemical processes - during which produces ATP.\nExcretion\nBiochemical reactions often result in the production of toxic waste products - these products are disposed via a method called excretion.\nPlants often store their waste.\nNutrition\nOrganisms obtain energy from food or from other sources - these sources provide energy that is needed for purposes such as cell growth, cell maintenance, and cell repair.\nAutotrophs take in simple, inorganic substances to turn into complex organic substances - these organisms are sometimes called producers. Plants - along with algae and phytoplankton - are the most familiar kind of autotrophs. Most autotrophs use photosynthesis to produce their own food.\nHeterotrophs take in ready-made substances - these organisms are known as consumers. Dogs, birds, fish, and humans are examples of heterotrophs; they occupy the second and third levels in a food chain.\nDetrivores (e.g., worms, fungi, and insects) obtain nutrition via consuming detritus: dead organic matter.\nThe food chain is a diagram that contains three trophic levels: autotrophs (first level), herbivores (second level), and carnivores and omnivores (third level).\nGrowth\nOrganisms grow by taking outside substances and incorporating it into its internal structure in a process called assimilation.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Divisions of Biology\nTraditionally, there were two: Zoology (the study of animals) and Botany (the study of plants). Over time, the following divisions appeared:\n\nMicrobiology\nThis is the study of microorganisms - this division can be divided into two more sub-divisions: bacteriology and virology.\nAnatomy\nThis is the study of plants’ and animals’ structures.\nBiochemistry\nThis is the study of chemical processes that underlie plant and animal life.\nCell Biology\nThis is the study of cell function and structure.\nEcology\nThis deals with the relationships of organisms and their environments.\nEvolution\nThis deals with how organisms evolve over time.\nGenetics\nThis is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity among living organisms.\nEntomology\nThis studies insects.\nOrnithology\nThis studies birds.\nHerpetology\nThis studies reptiles.\nMycology\nThis studies fungi.\nIchtyology\nThis studies fish.\nMalacology\nThis studies molluscs.\nPaleontology\nThis studies fossils and what they tell us about the ecologies of the past, about evolution, and about our place (as humans) in the world."

Chloroplasts are photosynthetic organelles - their job is to absorb light for photosynthesis.\n\n6.2.1 Chlorophyll\nChlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs and reflects specific wavelengths of light - these are also “light harvesting complexes”.\nThe most common kinds of chlorophyll are Chlorophyll A and Chlorophyll B. What separates them is their absorption spectrum.\n\n6.2.1.1 Discovery of Chlorophyll\nChlorophyll was found in 1817 by Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre Joseph Pelletier.\n70 years after the discovery of Chlorophyll C, Harold Strain and Winston Manning found Chlorophyll D in 1943.\nChlorophyll F - the latest chlorophyll discovery - was found by scientists at the University of Sydney by professor Min Chen’s group.\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Tree Loss Rates\n15.3 billion trees are cut down each year - the tree-to-person density ratio is about 422:1 for now.\nThe global amount of trees has fallen by 46% since the start of human civilization."

    "text": "6.4 Spontaneous Generation\n\n“Insects come into being spontaneously”\n– William Harvey (Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium, 1651)\n\nSpontaneous Generation is the idea that living organisms can originate from non-living organisms.\nBack in the days, it was believed that frogs, eels, mice, and other such organisms could arise spontaneously.\n\n6.4.1 Francesco Redi’s Experiments\nIn 1668, Redi carried out some experiments to show that maggots come from fly eggs, not rotting meat.\nAt that time, it was believed that maggots in rotting meat was evidence of spontaneous generation.\nRedi placed jars of meats in open air - one of them was covered in a fine muslin cloth. Redi saw that while flies of that particular jar would never get to the meat, they would still lay eggs on the cloth, hence disproving spontaneous generation as their origin.\nHowever, Redi still thought that some insects like gall flies arose by spontaneous generation.\n\n\n6.4.2 Pasteur’s Work\nHe carried 20 sterilized, sealed flasks high up in the Swiss Alps and opened them there.\nAnother set of flasks were also brought to the dusty streets of Paris. Only one flask in the Swiss Alps produced convincing proof of Pasteur’s position.\nPasteur’s work is recognized today as crucial in large scale effective control of disease.\nIf organisms spontaneously generated in decaying organic matter or other places, it would be very difficult to stop their natural formation unless one of the necessary ingredients, which was only hypothesized and never confirmed, was removed.\n\n6.4.2.1 Pasteur’s Swan Neck Experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of Pasteur’s Swan Neck Flask\n\n\n\n\nPasteur’s experiment went as such:\n\nNutrient broth was poured into two flasks: an open necked flask and a swan necked flask.\nBoth broths were boiled to kill existing microbes\nThe broths were then left open and allowed to cool\n\nIn the end, microbes in the air reached the opened flask, but were caught in the layer of moisture in the swan-necked flask’s neck. The former flask turned cloudy while the latter remained clear.\nPasteur’s swan-necked design allowed air to pass into the flask, but the curved neck trapped any airborne microbes that might contaminate the broth.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Practical Implications\nIf only life begets life, then it is only a matter of preventing life from reaching the organism which one wants to prevent from becoming contaminated.\nThis is the purpose of sealing food in air tight containers or for destroying the organisms which spread disease by methods that are strong enough to destroy most microorganisms, but not their host (e.g., cooking).\nThis technique is the ordinary and primary method used today to control germs, and thus disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nBastian’s The Beginning of Life\n\n\n\n\nThe spontaneous generation controversy continued for several years after the work of Pasteur with scientists who advocated grasping at every possible straw to save it. A London physician, Henry Charlton Bastian (1837–1915) published a two-volume work entitled The Beginning of Life where he cited difficulties with Pasteur’s experiments."

    "section": "6.5 Taxonomy",
    "text": "6.5 Taxonomy\nThis is science of naming, describing and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals and microorganisms of the world.\nUsing morphological, behavioural, genetic and biochemical observations, taxonomists identify, describe and arrange species into classifications, including those that are new to science.\nIn the past 250 years of research, taxonomists have named about 1.78 million species of animals, plants and micro-organisms, yet the total number of species is unknown and probably between 5 and 30 million.\n\n6.5.1 Species Problem\n\n“No other species displays such diversity as the dog.”\n– Karen Lange, Wolf to Woof\n\nAll dogs belong to the species Canis lupus familiaris, yet there are still many species.\nThe establishment of kennel clubs in the 1800s accelerated the process of artificial selection by encouraging new breeds. Most breeds established since 1900 were created for the sake of appearance.\n\n\n6.5.2 Why Study Taxonomy?\nTaxonomy helps us provide unique names for species and help us ensure that two different people are talking about the same organism. The Latin “scientific” name is given as a unique universal identifier.\n\n6.5.2.1 Modern Taxnomic Process\nTaxonomists begin by sorting specimens into sets that they think represent species.\nThey then go through the specimens to see if a specimen already has a name or not1.\nThese comparisons may also involve external characteristics, DNA analysis, or internal structure analysis too.\nIf no match is found, then a description has to be written, including ways that the species can be distinguished from other species. A new name (and one that is properly formatted) must also be formed.\nThis entire process can be length - it can take years.\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Carolus Linnaeus\n\n“Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.”\n– Genesis 2:19-20\n\nCarolus Linnaeus was born at Stenbrohult, in the province of Småland in southern Sweden on 23 May 1707.\nIn 1727, he studied medicine at the University of Lund, and a year later, he transferred to the University of Uppsala, where he spent time collecting and studying plants.\nAt the time, training in botany was part of the medical curriculum, for every doctor had to prepare and prescribe drugs derived from medicinal plants.\n\n6.5.3.1 Expedition to Lapland\nIn 1732, Linnaeus made an expedition to Lapland, the northernmost region of Sweden, with the objective of finding new plants, animals, and possibly valuable minerals.\nIn 1735, he completed his medical degree at the University of Harderwijk, and published the first edition of his classification of living things, the Systema Naturae.\nReturning to Sweden in 1738, he practiced medicine (specializing in the treatment of syphilis) and lectured in Stockholm before being awarded a professorship at Uppsala in 1741.\nAt Uppsala, he restored the University’s botanical garden (arranging the plants according to his system of classification), made three more expeditions to various parts of Sweden, and inspired a generation of students.\nHe was instrumental in arranging to have his students sent out on trade and exploration voyages to all parts of the world: nineteen of Linnaeus’s students went out on these voyages of discovery.\nHis most famous student, Daniel Solander, was the naturalist on Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world voyage, and brought back the first plant collections from Australia and the South Pacific to Europe.\nAnders Sparrman, another of Linnaeus’s students, was a botanist on James Cook’s second voyage.\nAnother student, Pehr Kalm, traveled in the northeastern American colonies for three years studying American plants.\nYet another, Carl Peter Thunberg, was the first Western naturalist to visit Japan in over a century. He not only studied the flora of Japan but taught Western medicine to Japanese practitioners.\nStill others of his students traveled to South America, southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many died on their travels.\n\n\n6.5.3.2 Swedish Economy\nLinnaeus was also deeply involved with ways to make the Swedish economy more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign trade, either by acclimatizing valuable plants to grow in Sweden or by finding native substitutes.\nUnfortunately, Linnaeus’s attempts to grow cacao, coffee, tea, bananas, rice, and mulberries proved unsuccessful in Sweden’s cold climate.\n\n\n\n6.5.4 Comparisons Between Kingdoms\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons Between Features in the Animal and Plant Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n“A few years ago Miss [Agnes] Joaquim, a lady residing in Singapore succeeded in crossing Vanda hookeriana and Vanda teres, two plants cultivated in almost every garden in Singapore.”\n– Henry Nicholas Ridley (1855 - 1956)\n\nSingapore’s national flower (i.e., the Papilionanthe) was bred by breeding two common household orchids together.\n\n\n6.5.5 Ernst H. Haeckel\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Kingdoms in the Taxonomy\n\n\n\n\nThe two-kingdom classification was adopted for a very long period in history of biological sciences.\nHowever, invention of microscope during the 16th century made it possible to explore the living world, which was not earlier possible to explore through the naked eye.\nThis exploration revealed an altogether new world of microorganisms sharing features of both plants and animals.\nFor example, Euglena are single-celled flagellated microorganisms that feature both plant and animal characteristics.\nOn the other hand, fungi have plant-like features such as immobility, irregular shape and indefinite growth but also posses heterotrophic mode of nutrition, a characteristic feature of animals.\nTherefore such microorganisms could not have appropriate placement in two-kingdom classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBright Field Microscopy on a Protist\n\n\n\n\nIn order to classify these microorganisms, Ernst H. Haeckel, in 1866, proposed a three-kingdom classification in which he added a new kingdom – Protista.\nIn this new kingdom he included all simple microscopic living organisms such as bacteria, microalgae, protozoa, fungi and sponges.\n\n\n6.5.6 Robert Whittaker\nRobert Whittaker worked on the area of classification, and developed three-kingdom, four-kingdom, and five-kingdom classification systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhittaker’s Five-Kingdom Classification System\n\n\n\n\nHis five-kingdom classification system, which he published in 1969, is featured in many biology textbooks.\nThe five kingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.\n\n6.5.6.1 Carl Richard Woese’s Domains\nIn 1990, Carl Richard Woese (1990) suggested further rectification in system of classification.\nRelying on the information gathered with the help of various techniques of molecular biology about different prokaryotes he proposed a revision.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoese’s Domains\n\n\n\n\nIn this classification, a new level – the domain – was introduced as the top category.\nThis taxonomic system is known as a three-domain classification that includes domains – Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya."

Democritus is also mentioned as being the teacher of Hippocrates who later treated him as a patient.\nHe came from a rich family. Later in his life, the people of Abdera tried Democritus in public and he was charged for spending the fatherly fortune.\nWhen he read them his works Great décor and On vulvar explaining that he spent the money on that, he was cleared.\nDemocritus is considered an erudite and a scientist with multiple interests, one of the most famous Greeks of his time, whom Sextus Empiricus compared with the voice of God Zeus. He is referred to as polyhistor (he who has a great and varied learning) and gelastinos (he who laughs at everything).\n\n6.6.1 Democritus’ Stance on Anatomy\nDemocritus’ views regarding the issue of human nature and anatomy are depicted in a letter he sent to Hippocrates of Kos.\nThe accuracy of his knowledge regarding the anatomy of the human body is explained by the plethora of dissections he had carried out, which results from his own writings.\nHowever, historians’ opinions on whether Democritus actually practiced cadaver dissection are contradictory. French historian Bouillet (1883) wrote:\n\n“Democritus dedicated long hours to dissection; his successors accused him of living in graves. True it was not, because he was never able to dissect human bodies”.\n– Bouillet\n\nGalen has left what has been called an abominable testimony, that Democritus used human parts and blood. Galen’s testimony therefore is in favour of the possibility that Democritus had actually practiced human dissections.\n\n\n6.6.2 Aristotle\nAristotle was born in Stagira, on the peninsula of Chalcidice in 384 BC.\nLater, he became the tutor of Alexander the Great, who was then 12. In about 336 BC, Alexander departed on his Asiatic campaign, and Aristotle, who had served as an informal adviser since Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne, returned to Athens and opened his own school of philosophy, the Lyceum.\nAlexander wrote books on zoology, astronomy, botany, poetry, drama, metaphysics, physics, ethics and other topics.\nWhile Plato distrusted the sphere of the senses, Aristotle did not. Like Plato, Aristotle conceded the role of the intellect in the acquisition of learning, but he regarded the senses as no less significant.\nThis to him, the physical cosmos was as vital as the spiritual, and was equally deserving of study.\nNot surprisingly, Aristotle wrote a number of volumes devoted specifically to physics and biology (e.g., De Animalia, or On the History of Animals).\n\n6.6.2.1 Aristotle’s Views on Taxonomy\n\n“Animals may be characterised according to their way of living, their actions, their habits, and their bodily parts.”\n– Aristotle\n\nAristotle was interested in categorising all life-forms. Many consider him the inaugurator of systematic taxonomy in the style of Linnaeus.\nUsing behaviour and native habitat as a guide, he divided all beasts into land animals, animals that always live in the water (e.g., fish), and animals that live periodically in the water, but reproducing on land (e.g., otter, alligators, and beavers).\nAristotle’s classification system had two principal divisions, the Genos and the Eidos. Genos signified broad categories of animals, such as a mammal, while Eidos referred to specific kinds of animals within the Genos, such as cats, horses, tigers, and so forth.\nAlexander the Great sent him most of the material he needed for his studies.\nAlthough his theories and specific classifications have altered considerably, several of the fundamental tenets still influence contemporary biology.\n\n\n6.6.2.2 Aristotle’s Views on Reproduction\nAristotle distinguished between sexual and asexual reproduction. The latter, he believed occurred via “spontaneous generation”.\nIn line with later thinking, Aristotle believed spontaneous generation occurred primarily in more primitive animals, such as fleas and mosquitoes, which could arise, spontaneously from decaying substances.\nAristotle was the first to realise that that mother and the father were of equal weight in the creation of a new organism.\n\n\n6.6.2.3 Aristotle and the “Vital Force”\nAristotle concluded that the heart controlled the flow of blood and was also the source of “animal heat” – the conviction that an undetectable, non-physical “force” keeps animals alive.\nWhat distinguishes animate from inanimate matter, such as a rock, is precisely that the latter does not have the “vital force” while the former does.\nIn 1928, Friedrich Wöhler demolished the concept of vitalism when he synthesized urea (CH4N2O) in his laboratory.\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Galen of Pergamum\nGalen was born in 131 in the city of Pergamum in Asia Minor. Although born a Greek, he later moved to Rome, fell in love with Roman culture, and even altered his name to the more Roman Claudius Galenus.\nAfter his philosophical training, Galen began to study medicine, first in Corinth, and later in Alexandria.\nHe returned to Pergamum in 158, becoming a court physician at the city’s school for gladiators. He then headed for Rome, where he began teaching science. There, he gained a reputation in medicine and became the personal physician of Marcus Aurelius.\nGalen also treated quite ordinary people – not only the wives, children, and slaves of the rich, but the peasants he encountered in the countryside, friends of friends he met in the street, and the miscellaneous patients who walked or were carried to the clinic he operated in his home. He claims have provided his services for free.\nBecause of this, he became a public figure, known and recognized by many, accosted in the streets, challenged to debate, accompanied everywhere by a crowd of friends, supporters, students, domestic servants, and professional assistants.\n\n6.6.3.1 Galen’s Speculations\nGalen used the pulse to diagnose illness, although he had no understanding of the circulatory system. He put together an encyclopedia of medical knowledge, relying heavily on Aristotle.\nFor the circulation of blood, he described the aorta and the primacy veins of dogs, pigs, sheep and other animals.\nHis discussions of the digestive system are an interesting blend of fact and fiction. He claimed that the stomach had a mysterious force called “transformation power”, which allowed it to digest food.\nTo pursue his anatomical ideas, Galen examined creatures of every imaginable species. He was unafraid to perform vivisection (dissecting a living body), except on human beings.\nHis descriptions of the circulatory system dispelled the myth that the left chamber of the heart contained air. Although he had no grasp of the importance of oxygen in physiology (Joseph Priestley only discovered oxygen in 1774), he did in a way anticipate this view when he defended the tenet that there was some hitherto undiscovered element in the blood which was the basis of life. Oxygen is, of course, this element.\n\n\n6.6.3.2 Galen’s Misshaps\nGalen made mistakes in his anatomy. He maintained (mistakenly) that both veins and arteries carried blood away from the heart, and that the wall between the left and right ventricles were porous, allowing blood to pass between them. He also claimed that the liver was the “seat” of the venous system.\nCultural taboos prevented Galen from dissecting human bodies, forcing him to rely on animals – a deficiency he candidly acknowledged and one that led to numerous errors.\n\n\n\n6.6.4 Leonardo da Vinci\nLeonardo was born in the village of Vinci, near Florence, in 1452. Many historians surmise that he actually dissected as many as thirty corpses in his youth.\nHe recorded his commentary in the form of notes and drawings, of which 4,000 pages are still extant.\nLeonardo’s finely detailed drawings helped others make headway in understanding the muscular and skeletal systems, and the relationship between them.\n\n6.6.4.1 Leonardo’s Work in Anatomy\nAnatomists in Leonardo’s time often dissected unclaimed bodies, such as of drunks and vagrants, and those bodies were more likely to be male.\nStudying them would have been obnoxious work because they didn’t have any form of embalming, and within two or three days, the body decomposes.\nBecause of this, Leonardo’s illustrations of human anatomy are uncannily accurate with just one major exception: the female reproductive system.\nMany of his drawings of the female reproductive system get details wrong.\n\n\n\n6.6.5 Andreas Vesalius\nAndreas Vesalius (née Andries van Wesel) was born in 1514 in Brussels.\nHe studied at the University of Louvain (1529 - 1533), then at the University of Paris (1523 - 1536).\nWhile in France, he took lessons from Jacobus Sylvius, an ardent Galenist and famous physician in his own right, who later came to oppose bitterly his student’s anatomical discoveries that denied the preeminence of the ancients.\nFinally, he transferred to the University of Padua – the premier medical university of the era – to complete his doctorate in December 1537.\n\n6.6.5.1 Vesalius’ Dissections\nUniquely for the era, Vesalius insisted on the importance of actual dissection, by both teacher and pupil, when learning anatomy.\nHis position afforded him time to study the human body. Vesalius began his anatomical studies shortly after assuming his Chair at Padua.\nHe personally dissected cadavers and encouraged / forced his students to do the same. Bodies typically came from the gallows or fresh graves.\nThe local magistrate courteously timed Padua’s executions around Vesalius’ needs.\nIt was this hands-on engagement that enabled Vesalius to master the subject and make his portentous discoveries. While a professor, he published several texts and a dissection manual for his students that portended his magnum opus.\nVesalius’ investigations culminated with his 1543 publication of De Human Corporis Fabrica Septem Libri, or Seven Books on the Fabric of the Human Body. A second edition, significantly revised and dramatically improved, appeared in 1555.\n\n\n6.6.5.2 Vesalius’ Seven Books\nHis seven books covered the following (in order):\n\nThe human skeleton\nMusculature of the human body\nVasculature of the human body\nThe human body’s nerves\nThe human body’s gastrointestinal system\nThe human heart and lungs\nThe brain\n\nIt was 663 pages, with 83 plates containing 420 illustrations, of which the “muscle men” remain the best known.\nScholars have debated for centuries who actually created the figures, with the artists Titian (c. 1488/90-1576) and van Calcar (c. 1499-1546) as leading contenders.\nMost medieval and early modern anatomy texts lacked any illustrations and relied on written description to portray the human body.\nVesalius’ images, in addition to their artistic beauty, illuminated the subject of anatomy for students and facilitated its mastery.\nTheir seamless integration within the text set a new standard for the field. Moreover, he initiated a trend, furthered by subsequent anatomists such as Fallopio, Eustachi, and Albinus, who likewise filled their works with gorgeous and useful images, a practice continued by Netter and other modern anatomists.\n\n\n\n6.6.6 Plastination\n\n\n\n\n\nvon Hagens with Two Plastinated Bodies\n\n\n\n\nIn July 1977, Gunther von Hagens was working as a research scientist at the University of Heidelberg’s Institute of Pathology and Anatomy.\nLooking at specimens embedded in plastic – the most advanced preservation technique then available – he wondered why the plastic was poured around bodies rather than into them.\nHe came up with the idea of vacuum-impregnation, whereby bodily fluids are drained and soluble fat are extracted and replaced with resins, silicon rubbers and epoxies – a process taking a year.\n\n“In the beginning, I thought plastination would mainly contribute to improving medical teaching.\nBut the huge subsequent lay interest inspired me to create public exhibitions – not to shock people, but capture their imaginations.”\n– Gunter von Hagens\n\nHe named the process plastination. After a year of intense research, and hundreds of experiments, he filed the first patent for plastination, a technique now used in 400 medical schools and universities worldwide, in March 1978.\n\n6.6.6.1 Public Displays\nThe first Body Worlds exhibition, featuring whole body plastinates, was shown in Japan in 1995.\nThe displays feature healthy and diseased body parts as well as skinned, whole corpses in assorted poses – a rider atop a horse, a pregnant woman reclining.\nIn 2018, von Hagens is suffering from Parkinson’s disease, and has requested to be plastinated when he dies, and become a permanent part of the Body Worlds exhibition.\nThe Body Worlds exhibition was held in Singapore in 2003 and in 2009.\nThe “The Cycle of Life” exhibit was excluded from the Singapore exhibition because it included copulating cadavers.\nCritics have denounced von Hagens’ work as disrespectful to the dead, others are appalled that dead bodies are used to make money. There was also controversy about the origin of his specimens. He has stated that the bodies of executed Chinese prisoners has not been used."

    "section": "6.7 William Harvey and the Heart",
    "text": "6.7 William Harvey and the Heart\nWilliam Harvey was born in Folkestone, Kent on 1 April 1578. His father was a merchant. Harvey was educated at King’s College, Canterbury and then at Cambridge University.\nHe then studied medicine at the University of Padua in Italy, completing his studies in 1602.\nHarvey married Elizabeth Browne, daughter of Elizabeth I’s physician, in 1604. In 1607, he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and, in 1609, was appointed physician to St Bartholomew’s Hospital.\nThrough his teachings and observations, Harvey began to develop a new theory to explain how blood flowed through the body.\nHe conducted thorough research, including numerous dissections of human beings and as many as 40 animal species.\nHarvey pored over the results before compiling them and publishing his groundbreaking Exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis in animalibus (On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals) in 1628.\nOnly about 70 pages long, it became a gigantic milestone.\n\n6.7.1 Heart Transplantation\nThe most controversial and famous operations of the twentieth century – human heart transplantation – was first performed by the South African surgeon Christiaan Neethling Barnard on 3 December 1967.\nPopular twentieth-century histories often single out this surgical endeavour as a great or defining moment in world history, as important as the moon-landing of 1969. On par with space travel, it has been frequently used to symbolise human ability and medical achievement.\nThe first heart transplants were as much media as medical events.\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, 2 December 1967, a car collided with a mother and daughter who were crossing a Cape Town road. The mother died instantly and her daughter, Denise Darvall, was left critically injured and unconscious. A motorist passed by the scene, unaware that the accident was irrevocably going to change her own family’s life.\nShe was on her way to visit her husband, dentist Louis Washkansky, who was in the nearby Groote Schuur Hospital suffering from end-stage cardiac disease. By 6 the next morning, Denise Darvell’s heart was beating inside Louis Washkansky’s chest. Christiaan Barnard, from the Groote Schuur Hospital, had led a team in conducting the first ever human-to-human heart transplant.\n\n“The young Republic of South Africa is rightly very proud of the magnificent feat achieved by a medical team at Groote Schuur Hospital in performing the first successful transplant of a human heart. The claim “successful” can be used even at this early stage because to date, it is a feat which makes medical history, no matter how short the further survival of the patient might be.”\n– South African Medical Journal\n\nLouis Washkansky died on 21 December 1967, eighteen days after receiving the heart of Denise Darvall.\n\n\n6.7.2 Gaspare Tagliocozzi\n\n\n\n\n\nA Patient After a Nose Job\n\n\n\n\nIn 1597, Gaspare Tagliacozzi, a professor of surgery at the University of Bologna, published De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem, an illustrated guide that documented for the first time a technique for performing a rhinoplasty, or nose job.\n\n“We restore, repair, and make whole those parts which nature has given but fortune has taken away, not so much that they delight the eye, but that they buoy up the spirit and help the mind of the afflicted.”\n– Tagliacozzi\n\nTagliacozzi improved the reconstructive surgery methods that had been developed in Italy in the 1400s and 1500s to repair noses which had been amputated, usually in war.\n\n6.7.2.1 Riducling Tagliacozzi’s Grafts\nThe Catholic Church judged that he had been tampering with the will of God and excommunicated him. Grafts became an object of ridicule. In 1909, the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal noted that by the eighteenth-century rhinoplasty “sank into disuse and in course of time began to be considered impossible or fabulous.”\nIn the subsequent centuries, reconstructive techniques improved, but the principle remained the same. Tissue used to repair a wound had to be taken from the patient’s own body. Otherwise, the immune system would attack and destroy it!\n\n\n6.7.2.2 “Uniqueness” of Individuals\n\n“The singular character of the individual entirely dissuades us from attempting this work on another person. For such is the force and power of individuality, that if anyone should believe that he could accelerate and increase the beauty of union, nay more, even achieve even the least part of the operation, we consider him plainly superstitious and badly grounded in the physical sciences.”\n– Tagliacozzi\n\nThe Venetian adventurer Nicolò Manuzzi (1639– 1717) settled in India and left a travelogue manuscript, published much later, in which he records that he had seen many natives with restored noses.\nManuzzi had acquired some surgical skills and was asked to repair a nose but to use a slave donor for the skin.\nManuzzi replied that “it would be of no avail, for being another’s flesh it would not unite”.\n\n“Concerning homoplastic transplantation (allografts) of organs such as the kidney, I have never found positive results to persist … whereas in autoplastic transplantation (autographs) the results was always positive. The biological side of the question has to be investigated very much more and we must find out by what means to prevent the reaction of the organism against a new organ.”\n– Alexis Carrel to Theodor Kocher\n\nNo one, though many experiments have been reported, has yet succeeded in keeping an animal alive for any great length of time which carried the kidney or kidneys of another animal after its own kidneys were removed.\nThe outlook is by no means hopeless and the principles of immunity, which yield such brilliant results in many other fields, would seem to ne worthy of being tested in this case.\n\n\n\n6.7.3 Cyclosporin\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Formula of Cyclosporin\n\n\n\n\nIn 1969, Sandoz biologist Hans Peter Frey, collected a soil sample which contained the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum (Beauveria nivea), from Hardangervidda, a national park in Norway. Sandoz encouraged employees to collect such samples on business trips and holidays to search for new antibiotic drugs from fungal metabolites.\nThe immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine was discovered on 31 January 1972 by employees of Sandoz (now Novartis), in a screening test on immune suppression designed and implemented by Hartmann Stähelin.\nThe extraordinary commercial success of cyclosporin is due to its immunosuppression and absence of cytotoxicity.\nAmong 170 liver transplants between 1967 and 1980, Thomas Starzl’s team reported only a 30% 1-year survival rate. Roy Calne’s series of 130 liver transplants between 1968 and 1983 achieved similar results.\nIt was apparent that acute and chronic rejection of the donor liver by the host immune system remained a major clinical problem that was limiting the efficacy of liver transplantation.\nIn 1978, Calne and others obtained extremely encouraging experimental results using cyclosporin in animal organ grafts, which was followed shortly by introduction into human transplantation.\nThree years later, Starzl reported a doubling of the 1-year survival rate of liver transplant recipients to about 60% using cyclosporine and prednisone for immunosuppression after liver transplantation.\nBetween January 1, 1988 and April 30, 2012, 115,458 liver transplants were performed in the USA alone. The 1-year survival of a liver transplant patient has improved to 85%–88%, and the 5-year survival is ∼74%."

    "section": "6.9 Diabetes and Insulin",
    "text": "6.9 Diabetes and Insulin\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease where the body does not make or does not use insulin properly, resulting in having too much sugar in the blood.\nSugar comes from the food we eat. The body needs sugar to make energy.\nThe amount of sugar in the blood of a normal person is closely controlled by a substance called insulin, which is made by the pancreas. People with diabetes either do not produce enough insulin or the insulin produced does not work well. As a result, sugar builds up in the blood.\nDiabetes is one of the most studied diseases in the history of medicine.\nDiabetes was first described in Ancient Egypt around 1552 BC (the Ebers Papyrus). Ever since then, physicians around the world tried to test and treat the “sugar sickness”, as it was called. However, with insulin still unknown, diabetics were doomed to waste away.\nDoctors in Egypt, India, and Greece all watched as the patients they desperately tried to save inevitably fell into comas and died. Indian physicians called it madhumeha (‘honey urine’) because it attracted ants.\n\n6.9.1 Where are the Pancreas?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of Pancreas\n\n\n\n\nThe pancreas is a long, flattened gland located deep in the abdomen. The pancreas contains exocrine glands that produce enzymes important to digestion.\nThe islets of Langerhans create and release important hormones (insulin and glucagon) directly into the bloodstream.\n\n\n6.9.2 Types of Diabetes\n\nType I Diabetes\nPersons with Type 1 diabetes cannot control their blood sugar properly because their pancreas produces little or no insulin. They need insulin injections to control their blood sugars. It usually happens to young people.\nType II Diabetes\nAbout 80% of all persons with diabetes belong to this group. They can produce insulin, but their body does not use it effectively. It is often the result poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n\n\n6.9.3 Statistics in Singapore\nAbout 9% of the adult population in Singapore have diabetes. 90% of people with diabetes are over 40 years old.\nSome risks of diabetes mellitus include:\n\nFamily history\nOverweight\nMore than 40 years of age\n\nPregnancy\nExposure to a trigger mechanism (a virus or chemical substance)\n\nAmong the major ethnic groups in Malaysia, Indians (24.9% in 2011 and 19.9% in 2006) had the highest prevalence of T2D, followed by Malays (16.9% in 2011 and 11.9% in 2006) and Chinese (13.8% in 2011 and 11.4% in 2006).\nThese epidemiologic differences could be due to the genetic makeup, diet, and cultural variants among these major ethnic groups.\n\n\n6.9.4 Origin of the word “Diabetes”\nThe term “diabetes” was probably introduced by the Greek physician Demetrius of Apamea or by Aretaeus of Cappadocia (129-199 AD).\nLater, the word mellitus (honey sweet) was added by Thomas Willis (Britain) in 1675 after rediscovering the sweetness of urine and blood of patients (first noticed by the ancient Indians).\nIn 1776, the Liverpool physician Matthew Dobson firstly confirmed the presence of excess sugar in urine and blood as a cause of their sweetness.\nDiabetes is a wonderful affection, not very frequent among men, being a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine. The course is the common one, namely, the kidneys and bladder; for the patients never stop making water, but the flow is incessant, as if from the opening of aqueducts.\nThe nature of the disease, then, is chronic, and it takes a long period to form; but the patient is short-lived, if the constitution of the disease be completely established; for the melting is rapid, the death speedy. Moreover, life is disgusting and painful; thirst, unquenchable; excessive drinking, which, however, is disproportionate to the large quantity of urine, for more urine is passed; and one cannot stop them either from drinking or making water.\n\n\n6.9.5 Pre-Insulin Era\nCharacterised by the efforts of controlling diabetes by means of bizarre pharmacological treatment such as the use of opium or dietary interventions, based on the conviction that diabetic patients should eat extra-portion for compensating their endocrinological and metabolic impairment.\nHowever, some physicians began to notice that it was fasting and not an excess of calories to improve the clinical symptoms of diabetes. They introduced dietary restrictions such as “Bouchardat’s treatment” or “starvation diets”.\n\n6.9.5.1 Paul Langerhans\nIn 1869, Paul Langerhans made the first careful and detailed description of the microscopic structure of the pancreas. He described nine different types of cells including small, irregularly shaped, polygonal cells without granules, which formed numerous cell heaps measuring 0.1 to 0.24 mm in diameter, throughout the gland. Langerhans refrained from making a hypothesis as to the nature and importance of these cells. In 1893, the French histologist GE Languesse named these spots “ilots de Langerhans”.\nIn 1875, Langerhans moved to the island of Madeira because of pulmonary tuberculosis, but he did not stop his scientific work.\nHe continued his zoological studies of the fauna of the Canary Islands and Madeira, and wrote a handbook for travelers to the island.\nLangerhans was also interested in his own disease and published two papers on tuberculosis.\nIn Madeira he practiced medicine in the capital, Funchal, where in 1888 he died of a kidney infection.\n\n\n\n6.9.6 Diabetes Cases and Treatments\nThe below cases were common:\n\nCase 1\nA man in his late fifties began to have severe pain in one of his toes, causing constant suffering and loss of sleep. Then, it began to turn black. His family doctor confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes which he himself had feared, since a brother and several members of his family had been diabetic.\nA surgeon, consulted in the hope that the gangrenous toe could be amputated, was unwilling to operate. He stated that, with diabetes, healing would fail to occur. The man was bedridden for months as the gangrene extended into his foot. Finally death came to end his suffering.\nCase 2\nA young girl with diabetes in an early stage, was treated with the Allen “starvation diet” then in vogue. Introduced by Dr. Frederick Madison Allen, and promoted by Dr. Elliott Proctor Joslin, dietary restriction of extreme degree was then the chief hope for juvenile diabetics. The results for this girl at first appeared successful, but suddenly diabetic coma developed, and she was gone.\n\nIn 1889, two German researchers, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering, discovered that removing a dog’s pancreas (total pancreatectomy) would provoke severe symptoms of diabetes.\nThey begun the speculation that a mysterious substance produced by the pancreas is responsible for metabolic control.\nIn 1907 a Belgian investigator Jean de Meyer proposed it be named “insulin”.\nThe discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto by in 1921-22 was one of the most dramatic events in the history of the treatment of disease.\nOn December 2, 1921, Leonard Thompson, 14, arrived at the emergency of Toronto General Hospital.\nHe weighed just 30 kg (as he had been on a “starvation diet”), and his life hung by a thread. His diabetes had been diagnosed two years earlier.\nThompson’s father let the hospital try Banting and Best’s new pancreatic extract for the first time.\nOn January 11, 1922, Leonard Thompson became the first patient with diabetes to receive insulin injections.\nAfter an impure form of insulin failed to improve Leonard’s condition initially, a purer version restored his blood glucose levels back to normal and his symptoms began to disappear.\nTwo weeks later, on 23 January 1922, Leonard underwent a second series of insulin injections and the results were stunning. His life was, literally, saved by insulin and he became the poster boy of the now commonplace medical miracle.\nWhen Leonard was aged 27, 13 years after his first insulin injections, he died of pneumonia, which was thought to be a complication of his diabetes.\n\n\n6.9.7 Controversy over Nobel Prize\nIn 1923, Frederick Banting and John MacLeod were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. The prize aroused a lively and debated controversy.\nIn 1955, the British biochemist Frederick Sanger managed to fully sequence the bovine insulin and discovered its exact composition in terms of amino-acids. For this discovery, Sanger won the Nobel for Chemistry in 1958.\nFor the discovery of the physical structure of insulin, the English biochemist Dorothy Mary Crowfoot-Hodgkin (1910–1994), a pioneer in the protein X-ray crystallography, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964."

    "text": "6.10 Insect Metamorphoses\nJan Swammerdam was born on 12 February 1637 in Amsterdam. He qualified as a medical candidate in October 1663.\nAfter obtaining his doctorate, Swammerdam concentrated mainly on the study of insects. The purpose of Swammerdam’s work on insects and other lower animals was to refute the Aristotelian idea that these were imperfect animals, by systematically contradicting the Aristotelian arguments that they lacked internal anatomy, originated spontaneous generation, and developed through an abrupt metamorphosis.\nWilliam Harvey proposed that the insect egg contains so scarce nutrients that the embryo is forced to hatch before completing development.\nThen, during the larval life, the animal would accumulate enough resources to reach the pupal stage, which Harvey considered as the perfect egg.\nSwammerdam showed that the pupa is not a sort of egg but a transitional stage between the larvae and the adult. He classified insect metamorphoses into four main types.\n\n6.10.1 Types of Metamorphoses\nThere are four kinds:\n\nType I\nInsects that grow without transformation (lice were his example)\nType II\nIn a second type, he included the species that develop the wings progressively and that transform into adults without any intermediate, quiescent stage (as crickets and cockroaches).\nType III\nRepresented by species whose wings develop under the larval cuticle and that undergo a quiescent pupal stage before transforming into adults (as in butterflies and beetles)\nType IV\nSpecies that pass the pupal stage under the skin of the last larval stage (represented by flies)\n\n\n\n6.10.2 Textbooks on Insects\nAlthough refined and completed with many examples, Swammerdam’s categories are essentially the same as the one used today.\nAmetabolans, which do not experience morphological transformations along the biological cycle.\nHemimetabolans, which hatch as nymphs with a morphology similar to that of the adult and grow progressively until the adult stage, which gain full flying wings and functional genitalia.\nHolometabolans, which hatch as a larva morphologically very different from the adult, then progressively grow through successive moults until the last larval instar, after which they moult into the pupal stage, often quiescent and similar to the adult, and then to the adult stage, with flying wings and fully formed and functional genitalia."

    "text": "6.11 Vitamins\nGelatin (also called gelatine) is an animal protein prepared by the thermal denaturation of collagen, isolated from animal skin and bones, with very dilute acid. It can also be extracted from fish skins.\nChemically, gelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of single or multi-stranded polypeptides. More about this in a later lecture (on biochemistry)!\nFor now, let’s go back to Paris in the early 1800s. Philanthropists were seeking ways to feed the poor. Chemists discovered that gelatin could be extracted from leftover bones.\nSo they came up with an idea – people of means could consume the meat, while the poor would receive a gelatin broth. However, the poor revolted against the unappetizing broth.\nThe authorities appointed a committee, the Gelatin Commission, to evaluate gelatin. After ten years of research, the Commission concluded that gelatin was not a complete food.\nBy the late nineteenth century, the prevailing dogma held that there were four essential elements of nutrition: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals.\n\n6.11.1 Cause of Disease: Germ Theory\nGerm theory, that diseases are caused by infectious organisms or toxins produced by these organisms became the reigning principle in science.\nLouis Pasteur (1822 – 1895) and Robert Koch (1843 – 1910) were influential proponents of the germ theory of disease.\nInvestigations identified the organisms responsible for anthrax, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, leprosy, and diphtheria.\nOther diseases such as scurvy, beriberi, rickets, and pellagra – considered by some to be infections – continued to baffle scientists.\n\n“Scurvy and rickets are conditions so severe that they force themselves upon our attention; but many other nutritive errors affect the health of individuals to a degree most important to themselves, and some of them depend upon unsuspected dietetic factors …”\n– Frederick Gowland Hopkins\n\nIn a speech in 1906, Frederick Gowland Hopkins stated that “… no animal can live upon a mixture of pure protein fat, and carbohydrate, and even when the necessary inorganic material [i.e., minerals] is carefully supplied the animal still cannot flourish.”\n\n“Mice can live quite well under these conditions when receiving suitable foods (e. g., milk), however, as the above experiments demonstrate that they are unable to live on proteins, fats, carbohydrates, salts, and water, it follows that other substances indispensable for nutrition must be present in milk …”.\n– Nicolai Lunin\n\nCarl Socin, demonstrated that there was an unknown substance in egg yolk that was essential to life, and he raised the question of whether this substance was fat-like in nature.\n\n\n6.11.2 During the Seige of Paris\n\n“Since no conscientious chemist can assert that the analysis of milk has made known all the products necessary for life … we must renounce, for the present, the pretension to make milk. … It is therefore always prudent to abstain from pronouncing upon the identity of these indefinite substances employed in the sustenance of life, in which the smallest and most insignificant traces of matter may prove to be not only efficacious, but even indispensable … The siege of Paris will have proved that we… must still leave to nurses the mission of producing milk.”\n– Dumas\n\nMany infants and toddlers died when the city was cut off from the milk supply of the countryside. Some opportunists tried to manufacture an artificial substitute for cows’ milk, but this artificial milk failed to sustain the infants. Many children died.\n\n\n6.11.3 Vitamins\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists who Discovered Vitamins\n\n\n\n\nIn 1912, Hopkins showed that young rats did not grow well when fed a basal ration of protein, starch, cane sugar, lard, and minerals. After a small amount of milk was added to the basal ration, they had normal growth. The unknown factors in milk that supported life were found in “astonishingly small amounts” and were termed “accessory factors” by Hopkins.\nCasimir Funk (1884 – 1967) proposed the term “vitamine” instead of “accessory food factors” in 1912 for the deficient substances in the food as related to beriberi, scurvy, and pellagra.\nIn 1913, University of Wisconsin biochemist Elmer McCollum (1879–1967) was able to distinguish two different species of vitamins, which he called “fat-soluble factor A” and “water-soluble factor B.”\nThe announcements by Hopkins, Funk, McCollum and others sparked enormous worldwide interest in this new area of research. Over time, more vitamins were discovered."
