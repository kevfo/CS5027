    "text": "1.1 Singapore’s Past\n\n“A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade, regardless of its mechanical skill.”\n– Bush, 1945\n\nWhen Singapore separated from Malaysia, its focus was put on survival as it was a nation with no natural resources. One such tool that would enable Singapore to survive was through Science: a necessary pre-requisite for industrial and technological advancement.\nIn February 1966, Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye1 announced a proposal for forming a new statutory board: the Science Council of Singapore.\n\n1.1.1 Science Council of Singapore (i.e., SCS)\nThis board was established in 1967 - the board would make reports and suggest recommendations on:\n\nScientific and technological research and developments.\nEffective training and utilization of scientific and technological manpower in Singapore.\nEstablishing official relations with other scientific organizations.\n\nIn 1968, the board suggested establishing a science center in Singapore - this was suggested to the Minister of Science and Technology.\nShortly after, a special committee was appointed to come up with the preparatory work and submit proposals for setting up the center - this committee included:\n\nA chairman: Ronald Sng Ewe Min\nThree members:\n\nSng Yew Chong\nRex Anthony Shelley\nBernard Tan Tiong Gie\n\n\n\n1.1.1.1 Science and Industry Quiz (i.e., SIQ)\nThe SCS thought that one way to popularize science and technology over the television would be to combine education with entertainment.\nSecondary school students would form teams and participate in the SIQ. Each team would have four members: two members would participate in the quiz programme and the other two on standby.\nThere are two rounds to the SIQ:\n\nPreliminary Round\nAll competing teams had two sets of question papers: Set A and Set B.\nSet A had 100 questions; Set B had 50 questions. Each team had 15 minutes to answer both sets.\nThe first preliminary round was held at the Raffles Institution Hall on 28 July, 1972. 54 Teams competed, but only 12 were selected for the Televised Series.\nTelevised Series\nThere were three stages - the four Quarter Finals, two Semi-Finals, and a Final.\nEach of the televised series had four rounds. The first round was where each team would have a fixed amount of time to answer as many questions as they could.\nThe second round consisted of questions being asked to each individual of a team. The question had to be answered within a minute and with no assistance.\nRound three posed a question to all team members - the team had to answer the question unanimously. The six questions posed in this round enabled problem-solving and teamwork skills.\nThe fourth final round was a buzzer-style question triva session.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.2 The Innovators\nIn 1979, the SIQ was replaced by The Innovators.\nThe Innovators was a series of six programs where JC2 students would work with Radio Television Singapura producers to produce television programs that had a scientific or technological theme, but focused on innovation.\nThe top three programs included:\n\n“…And Life Goes On”\n“Food Encounters”\n“The Miracle Gene”\n\nThese three programs were selected by a panel of judges - the student producers were awarded prizes too.\n\n\n1.1.1.3 Opening of the Science Center\n\n“While formal educational institutions make sure we are raising a nation of “science literate people”, Science Centre Singapore takes this to the next level.\nWe make science accessible and engaging, creating an environment where Singaporeans are empowered to advance their own learning and, hopefully, are inspired to do something incredible with their futures.\nAdmission (just to the Science Centre) is $6 for adults and $4 for children.”\n– Science Center’s justification\n\nThe Science Center aimed to be a place where “Science befriends and transforms the minds of millions”.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to Singapore’s Science Center\n\n\n\n\nIt also aimed to promote interest, learning, and creativity in science and technology via imaginative and enjoyable experiences (that contribute to Singapore’s human resources).\n\n1.1.1.3.1 Redeveloping the Science Center\n\n“Many people whom I have spoken to remember the Science Center fondly, and can even name specific exhibits that have inspired them. The new Science Centre gives us an opportunity to do even more – to help our young learn through play and fun, to inculcate a love and wonder for science and technology among Singaporeans and to kindle a passion for lifelong learning and inquiry.”\n– Mr. Koh\n\nThe above was mentioned by Koh Boon Hwee during 12 November, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 National Science and Technology Board (i.e., NSTB)\nThis was formed in October 1990 (after the passing of the bill); and the enactment of the Science and Technology Board act the following month.\nThe NSTB was a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade & Industry (i.e., MTI).\nThe NSTB developed Singapore into a center of excellence in certain fields of science and technology to enhance national competitiveness in industrial and service sectors (i.e., industry-driven research and development).\n\n1.1.2.1 A*STAR\nOn 5 January 2002, the NSTB was reorganized and renamed to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (i.e., A*STAR).\n\n\n\n\n\nA*STAR’s Homepage\n\n\n\n\nA*STAR aimed to promote mission-oriented research that advances scientific discovery and technological innovations.\nThe agency got a portion of the national science and technology’s budget as a show of support. Its facilities are currently located at Biopolis and Fusionopolis (at one-north).\n\n1.1.2.1.1 A*STAR’s Mission\nA*STAR aims to develop Singapore’s science, technology, and engineering capabilities to boost Singapore’s economic growth via the three ways:\n\nDeveloping the manpower required for the science and technology sectors.\nPioneering research and development to drive innovation and enhance the Singapore’s knowledge-based economy.\nMonetizing results in research and development.\n\nRegarding the final point, A*STAR’s commercialization arm manages its intellectual property and also helps apply its research to industry.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (i.e., LKCNHM)\nThe LKCNHM - formerly known as the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (i.e., RMBR) - was opened on 18 April, 2015 by Dr. Tony Tan Keng Yun: the president and chancellor of the National University of Singapore.\nThe museum strives to be a leader in Southeast Asian biodiversity in research, education, and outreach.\nMrs. Della Lee3 donated enough money to enable LKCNHM to purchase three dinosaur skeletons.\n\n\n1.1.4 NUS High School of Mathematics and Science\nThe school’s mission was to shape the future of education in mathematics and science by producing future-ready pioneers, humanitarians, and innovators for the world.\nThe school’s motto is: Experiment. Explore. Excel.\n\n\n1.1.5 Singapore National Academy of Sciences (i.e., SNAS)\nIn 31 July, 1967, scientists collectively formed the SNAS - a scholarly and professional body. The SNAS was meant to become the equivalent of the UK’s Royal Society or the USA’s National Academy of Sciences.\nThe SNAS was formed with the following objectives:\n\nPromoting the advancement of science and technology in Singapore\nDiscussing scientific, technological, and macroeconomic problems (especially those that concern the nation)\nRepresenting members’ scientific opinions and fellows of the academy"

    "text": "1.2 Singapore’s Return on Investment\nThis sub-section discusses some of Singapore’s results with regards to its investment in science and technology.\n\n1.2.1 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (i.e., TIMSS)\nThe TIMSS is developed and executed at the international level by the International Association for the Evaluation of Education Assessment (i.e., IEA).\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s TIMSS Results in Science\n\n\n\n\nThe TIMSS happens once every four years (the latest one was in 2019) - Singapore has partook in every study.\n\n1.2.1.1 Scope of the TIMSS\nThe TIMSS gauges the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth and eighth graders (i.e., primary four and secondary 2 respectively). However, some countries only participate at the eighth-grade level.\nThe TIMSS allows for an international benchmark in three bands and along two dimensions - content and cognitive domains:\n\nAverage is higher than the US’\nAverage score is not measurably different from the US’\nAverage score is lower than the US’\n\nResults may wildly differ between countries, but the reasons are attributed to students’ attitudes, educational aspirations, school climates (e.g., violence in schools), school resources, and safety.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Programme for International Student Assessment (e.g., PISA)\nThe PISA is a study done once every three years and is run by the Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (i.e., OECD).\nSingapore’s 15-year olds were ranked first in mathematics, science, and reading in 2015 (i.e., Singaporean students were the best in the world when it comes to working in teams to solve problems).\nHence, Singaporean students are very well equipped for the future’s opportunities and challenges - they have a high ability to work well independently and together.\nIn 2018, Singapore came in second place in all three categories (China took first place).\n\n\n1.2.3 Times Higher Education (i.e., THE) University Rankings\nIn 2019, NTU and NUS were ranked 51 and 23 on the THE world university rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS Rankings for NTU and NUS in 2019\n\n\n\n\nThe Quacquarelli Symonds (i.e., QS) rankings ranked NTU and NUS at 12 and 11 respectively - SMU was ranked at 500. Both NTU and NUS were ranked at 11 in the QS rankings in 2020 - SMU was at 477.\n\n\n1.2.4 President’s Science and Technology Award (i.e., PSTA)\nThe PSTA recognizes individuals with creative ideas who have made significant contributions to Singapore.\nSo far, over 60 men and women who have been singled out for this.\n\n\n1.2.5 International Olympiads\nThis following sub sub-section lists Singapore’s performances in the International Olympiads:\n\nMath\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Math Olympiad (i.e., IMO)\n\n\n\n\nThe first math olympiad (i.e., IMO) was held in 1959 in Romania with 7 countries’ participants. Over the years, 100 counries from five continents have participated.\nThe competition is overseen by the IMO board - they also ensure that each host country upholds the traditions of the IMO.\nInformatics\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Olympiads in Informatics (i.e, IOI)\n\n\n\n\nThe IOI is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students - the first IOI happened in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria.\nThe contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving in algorithms.\nBiology\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Biology Olympiad (i.e., IBO)\n\n\n\n\nThe IBO is a competition that tackles Biological problems and deals with Biological experiments (i.e., testing them). The IBO challenges and stimulates participants to expand their talents and to promote participants’ careers as scientists.\nChemistry\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the 30th International Chemistry Olympiad (i.e., IChO)\n\n\n\n\nThe IChO is an annual Chemistry for a nation’s most talented high-schoolers. Nations send a team of four students who are tested on their Chemistry knowledge and skills in a five-hour laboratory practical and five-hour written theoretical examination that are both held on different days.\nYoung Physicists’ Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Young Physicists’ Tournament (i.e., IYPT)\n\n\n\n\nThe IYPT (sometimes called the “Physics World Cup”) is a team-oriented competition for secondary school students.\nParticipants present their solutions to scientific problems they have prepared over several months and then discuss their solutions with other teams.\nAstronomy and Astrophysics (i.e., IOAA)\nThe IOAA promotes interest in astronomy and similar subjects by developing “international contacts” between different schools to promote Astronomy and Astrophysics in schools.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Singapore’s Scientific Pioneers\n\n\n\n\n\nA Book on Singapore’s Scientific Pioneers\n\n\n\n\nThe book shown above contains information on 25 individuals who laid foundations for Singapore’s scientific achievements.\nAll of these scientists were born prior to Singapore’s independence, but have made exceptional contributions to Singapore’s engineering, medical, educational, and scientific sectors.\nSome of these people include:\n\nBenjamin Henry Sheares\nHe was the father of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Singapore. He has a procedure named after him and was one of the top graduates of the King Edward VII College of Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shears Bridge in Singapore\n\n\n\n\nHe was also Singapore’s second president - he also has a bridge named after him: the Benjamin Sheares Bridge (which is one of Singapore’s most famous landmarks).\nShih Choong Fong\nShih was the president of NUS from 2000 to 2008 and also the founding president for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (i.e., KAUST) in from 2008 to 2013.\nShih got a PhD from Harvard in 1973 and led the Fracture Research Group at the GE Corporate Research Lab in the US. In 1981, he joined Brown University. He was appointed University Professor by NUS in 2013 and was inducted into the Honorary Membership by NUSS in 2001.\nTay Eng Soon\nSoon was more well-known as a politician. He was a minister of state in the Ministry of Education from 1980 until he died in 1993.\nSoon worked hard to develop polytechnics and ITEs.\nHis speciality was in nuclear energy and nuclear power."

    "section": "1.3 What is Science?",
    "text": "1.3 What is Science?\n\n“Science is a voyage of intellectual exploration, and an expression of the human spirit.”\n– Henry Stommel, 1989\n\nIn 1834, William Whewell4 (1794 - 1866) coined the term “scientist”5.\nHe was also the master of of Trinity College at Cambridge; he was also a founding member and a president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n1.3.1 Scientific Worldview\nThe world is seen as such by a scientist:\n\nThe world is understandable\nScientific ideas can change\nScientific knowledge is everlasting\nScience cannot answer everything\nScience is an enterprise\n\nScience is a blend of logic and imagination - logic is used to understand why things happen while one’s creativity is used to recognize the meaning of something unexpected.\n\n1.3.1.1 The World is Understandable\nStuff that happens in this world have a consistent pattern that can be seen through close observation.\nBy using one’s intellect along with instruments, people can find all sorts of patterns.\nThe universe is a system where the basic rules are the same.\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Scientific Ideas can Change\nNew observations can challenge existing theories, in which case, new theories may be needed to explain the observation.\nScience is humanity’s attempt at explaining how the universe works.\nTesting, improving, and discarding theories is an ongoing process in Science.\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Scientific Knowledge is Everlasting\nModifying ideas (instead of rejecting them) is a norm in science. Powerful constructs survive and grow more precise so that they are more widely accepted.\nEinstein did not reject the Newtonian law of motion, but only showed them to be a limited application with a more general concept.\n\n\n1.3.1.4 Science Cannot Answer Everything\nMany beliefs fall into this category (e.g., supernatural forces, true purpose of life, etc).\nIn some cases, science may even be seen as irrelevant by people hwo have certain beliefs (e.g., fortune tellers)\n\n\n1.3.1.5 Science is an Enterprise\nScience is a complex, social activity that involves many individuals of many backgrounds.\nScientific research is also competitive in that researchers compete for funding - committees meet up to decide which topic(s) should be focused on.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Components of Science\nScience has certain elements:\n\n1.3.2.1 Scientific Enquiry\nScience demands evidence; scientists focus on collecting accurate data (which are verified by others).\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Making Observations\nTo make observations, scientists must use:\n\nTheir five senses\nInstruments that enhance those senses\nInstruments that go beyond the human senses\n\n\n\n1.3.2.3 Attitudes\nScientists need to be willing to work hard, to have courage, and to embrace openness (i.e., be willing to change).\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Ways of Observation\nScientists…\n\nObserve passively (i.e., watch things happen without interefering)\nMake collections (i.e., collecting samples)\nActively probe the world (e.g., conducting clinical trials, etc).\n\nOtherwise, they also…\n\nExplain and Predict\nScientists use observations to construct explanations for them.\nThese hypotheses should also fit additional observations.\nIdentify and Avoid Bias\nScientific evidence can be biased in how scientists choose to report those facts (or the kind of data collected to begin with).\nA scientist’s nationality, sex, age, and other factors may cause them to look for one kind of evidence or interpretation.\nA possible safeguard against this is to have many different people involved working on the same problem.\nRealize that nobody is omniscient (i.e., all-knowing)\nNo scientist had the right to decide for themselves what is “true”.\nScientist whose observations do not align with mainstream ideas may encounter vigorous criticisms - these scientists may also have difficulty garnering support for their research.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Creative-Failure Methodology\n\n“A basic truth that the history of the creation of the transistor reveals is that the foundations of transistor electronics were created by making errors and following hunches that failed to give what was expected.”\n– William Shockley\n\nWilliam Shockley - inventor of the transistor - started with a concept of the tubeless radio and used trial and error to make his invention.\n\n\n1.3.5 Communication and Organization in Science\nScience can be communicated in a variety of ways, some of which include:\n\nCommunicating with the Public\nScience is too important for the public to stay in the lab.\nMany scientists too feel a need to inform the public about potentially dangerous misconceptions or to counter misinformation from numerous quarters.\n\nScience is also organized into content disciplines - it is a collection of scientific fields (that provide a foundation of research).\nDifferent fields in science also spill into one another (e.g., Biochemistry, Biophysics, etc).\n\n\n1.3.6 A “Right” Way to Perform Science\nThere are ethical principles to conducting science - competition has led to unethical practices such as:\n\nScientists withholding information and falsifying findings\nThese violations damage science, the scientific community, and the funding agencies.\nTreating live subjects\nFor instance, human subjects should only be used for a study if they consent to it. Part of this also means disclosing the risks and intended benefits of research.\nScientists as Experts and Advisors\nScientists partake in public affairs as specialists and as citizens.\nScientists help the public and its representatives to help understand what most likely happened.\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Why is Science so Important?\nScience is so important (and specialised) that the President of the United States has a 25-member panel, known as the “National Science Board” to serve as advisors to him and the Congress on policy matters related to science and engineering, and education in both fields.\nThe National Science Board has its members drawn from industry and academia. Vannevar Bush was the first Presidential Science Advisor, and also head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). He oversaw most of America’s scientific research during World War II.\n\n\n1.3.8 Science in Courtrooms\nAn increasing number of legal disputes involve the principles and tools of science. Properly resolving those disputes matters not just to the litigants, but also to the general public – those who live in our technologically complex society and whom the law must serve.\nThe decisions of the judges should reflect a proper scientific and technical understanding so that the law can respond to the needs of the public"

    "text": "1.5 Technology\nTechnology extends our abilities to change the world: to cut, shape, or put together materials; to reach farther with our hands, voices, and senses.\nWe use technology to try to change the world to suite us better The changes may relate to survival needs such as food, shelter, or defense, or they may relate to human aspirations such as knowledge, art, or control.\nBut the results of changing the world are often complicated and unpredictable.\nThey can include unexpected benefits, costs, or risks.\n\n1.5.1 Is it Practical?\nEngineering combines scientific enquiry and practical values In its broadest sense, engineering consists of construing a problem and designing a solution for it.\nEngineering shares many characteristics with science, but engineering affects the social system and culture more directly than scientific research.\n\n1.5.1.1 There is No Perfect Design\nThere is no perfect design as accommodating one constraint leads to conflict with another.\nAll technologies involve control, e.g., in an iron (or an air-conditioned room, or a rice cooker), the temperature is controlled within a preset range.\nControl typically requires feedback, logical comparisons, and a means for activating change\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Side Effects\nTechnologies have side effects  what is one side effect of X-ray? personal computers? mobile phones? the Internet? photocopy machines? the automobile? social media?\nSystematic risk analysis is used to minimise the impact of side effects (e.g., the side effect of X-ray is cancer)\nThere may also be unintended benefits / consequences:\n\nSuntan lotion\nThe main ingredient, titanium dioxide, mixed with water, results in hydrogen peroxide. This kills phytoplankton that nourishes fish and ultimately poisons the rest of the food chain.\n\nTechnology can also fail too (e.g., crashing of the space shuttle).\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Issues in Technology\nIssues have also emerged  overuse of fossil fuels, pollution, global warming, new bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics, digital divide, deforestation, extinction of plants and animals, strain on the soil and water systems, and more.\n\n1.5.2.1 Pseudoscience\nIn prescientific times, any attempt to harness nature mean forcing nature against her will, Nature had to be subjugated, usually with some form of magic, or by means that were “above” nature – that is, supernatural.\nScience does the exact opposite, it works “within” nature’s laws. The methods of science have largely displaced reliance on the supernatural.\nThe old ways persist, full force in primitive cultures, and they survive in technologically advanced societies too, usually disguised as science.\n\n1.5.2.1.1 No Science! Column\nIn his book, Flim-Flam!, James Randi reported that more than 20,000 practising astrologers in the United States serve millions of credulous believers.\nScience writer Martin Gardner reports that a greater percentage of Americans today believe in astrology and occult phenomena than did citizens of medieval Europe.\nFew newspapers print a daily science column, but nearly all provide daily horoscopes.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.2 Science Denialism\n\nDenialism refers to “the employment of rhetorical arguments to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists”.\n– CS5027 Course Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Consequence of Thabo Mbeki’s Science Denialism\n\n\n\n\nThabo Mbeki’s (the second president of South Africa) denial of science has led to the deaths of many people."

A scientist is used to represent a particular kind of research1.\n\n2.1.1 Bohr’s Quadrant\nResearch here is done for the sake of discovery (i.e., for knowledge purposes).\nThere is no attention to the research’s practicality\n\n\n2.1.2 Edison’s Quadrant\n\n“Edison never allowed himself or those working with him in Menlo Park five minutes to consider the underlying side of the significance of what they were discovering in their headlong rush toward commercial illumination.\nThe value and even the mark of true science consists, in my opinion, in the useful inventions which can be derived from it.”\n– Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n\nResearch in this quadrant is done for the sake of applications. When Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, he wasn’t interested in the science behind the device, but the potential applications and revenue that could be generated from the light bulb.\n\n\n2.1.3 Pasteur’s Quadrant\nThis quadrant was a mix of both Bohr’s and Edison’s quadrants: research in this quadrant was a mix of both practical applications and discovering new knowledge.\nPasteur not only studied the disease that was ruining southern France’s silkworm industry, but also anthrax, rabies, and fermentation and brewing in the beer industry."

    "section": "2.3 Types of Innovation",
    "text": "2.3 Types of Innovation\n\n“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”\n– Steve Jobs\n\n\n“Leave the beaten track occasionally and dive into the woods. Every time you do so you will be certain to find something that you have never seen before.”\n– Bell Labs’ Motto\n\nAn innovation is a series of activities that begin when an idea is conceived. This idea then undergoes a series of research, development, engineering, design, market analysis, management decision making, and so on before ending at product realization.\nInnovations are like creations and exploitations of new flowers.\n\n“Innovations, like flowers, start from tiny seeds and have to be nurtured carefully until they blossom, then their essence has to be carried elsewhere for the flowers to spread.\nInnovations can grow wild, springing up weed-like despite unfavourable circumstances.\nAnd some conditions - soil, climate, fertilizer, the layout of the garden - produce larger and more abundant flowers.”\n– Professor himself\n\nInnovations can be broadly divided into several categories:\n\nProduct Innovations\nThis is the introduction of a good or a service that is new or is significantly improved in some way (i.e., technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness, or other functional characteristics).\nSuch innovations can be based on new ideas and technologies (or a combination of existing and new ideas and technologies).\nProcess Innovations\nThese are the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method (which often includes changes in techniques, equipment, and / or software).\nSuch innovations are often made to decrease unit costs, to increase quality, or to produce or deliver significantly improved products.\nThese innovations also deal with the steps in making a product.\nService Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nService Kiosks at McDonalds’\n\n\n\n\nThese are intangible methods of serving users at a new level of performance - for instance, new service concepts.\nRadical Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP3 Logo\n\n\n\n\nThese are big and major changes in products.\nThe MP3 audio system is one major example. Prior to the invention of MP3, music was listened to communally.\nIncremental Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition from Mentos Mint Candy to Mentos Caramels\n\n\n\n\nThese apply existing knowledge to improve products.\n\n\n2.3.1 Innovation as Work\nInnovation is the work of knowing, not doing. It’s also an effort to purposeful, forced change in an enterprise’s economic or social position.\n\n“I am not pleading with you to make changes. I am telling you you have got to make them – not because I say so, but because old Father Time will take care of you if you don’t change. Advancing waves of other people’s progress sweep over the unchanging man and wash him out. Consequently, you need to organise a department of systematic change-making.”\n– Charles F. Kettering\n\nInnovation requires knowledge, ingenuity, and boldness. If a person lacks persistence and commitment, then talent, knowledge, and ingenuity will not be useful.\n\n“Businessmen go down with their businesses because they like the old way so well they cannot bring themselves to change. One sees them all about - men who do not know that yesterday is past, and who woke up this morning with their last year’s ideas.”\n– Henry Ford\n\nInnovation is a specific function of entrepreneurship, whether that be in the form of an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by an individual.\n\n\n2.3.2 Characteristics of Innovation\nKanter (1998) suggested the following traits of most, if not all innovations:\n\nUncertainty\nSources of innovation may be unpredictable - the goal of innovation may have little to base itself off of.\nInnovations make progress in spurts in unforseen moments.\nA Long Journey\nThe costs of innovation may overrun and the results are highly uncertain.\nAnalysts have estimated that it may take years for a business to see any returns on their innovations.\nKnowledge-Intensive\nThe innovation process generates new knowledge and in doing so, uses human intelligence and creativity. This learning curve is steep.\nEfforts during innovation are vulnerable to leaving because of the loss of knowledge and experience (i.e.,\nControversial\nInnovations are always competitive - they provide an alternative course of action.\nOn several occassions, an innovation may be a threat to peoples’ interests (whether that “interest” be a salesperson receiving high commissions or whatnot).\nPolitical problems are often the primary cause for the failure of new venture departments in corporations.\nImperialistic\nAn innovation is also capable of crossing boundaries.\nThere is also evidence that the best ideas or interdisciplinary (i.e., they benefit from broader perspectives and from information outside of the idea responsible for the innovation).\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Example #1: Scrabble\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Playing Scrabble\n\n\n\n\nIn 1931, Alfred Mosher Butts was a young, out-of-work architect who was seeking a means of making money.\nButts was interested in anagrams and crossword puzzles (i.e., his source of inspiration) - after further analysis, he found that games of his generation fell into one of three categories:\n\nNumber-based games\nMove-based games\nWord-based games\n\nHe eventually created a game that used a grid and words. Butts wanted his game to have both skill and luck (with a stronger emphasis on skill). Butts also realized that of the 26 characters in the alphabet, that not all of them were used frequently.\nTo find out the relative frequencies, he painstakingly studied the front pages of the New York Times, doing letter-by-letter counts (i.e., innovation is knowledge-intensive).\nThis enabled Butts to assign values to each letter in his game.\nFrom 1932 to 1938, Butts made the sets by hand and gave them to friends; most game manufacturers in the US turned down Butts’ idea.\nIn 1943, Butts met marketing genius James Brunot - Brunot made some refinements to Butts’ game.\nEventually, Brunot and his wife made an agreement with Selchow & Righter, a much more established game manufacturer to make the game (as Brunot could not keep up with game production himself).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Irish Scrabble Association\n\n\n\n\nBy 1954, more than 4 million sets of the game had been sold; the game was also available in other languages (e.g., Spanish, Italian, French, etc).\nIn 1972, Selchow & Righter purchased the game and trademarked “Scrabble”.\nHasbro now supports the National Scrabble Association (It was formerly Coleco, but they went bankrupt).\n\n\n2.3.4 Example #2: Barbie Dolls\n\n\n\n\n\nA Barbie Doll Holding a Plastic Video Recorder\n\n\n\n\nIn 1956, American businesswoman Ruth Handler was vacationing in Switzerland until she came across Bild Lilli: a prostitute doll with long legs and heavy makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bild Lilli Doll\n\n\n\n\nThe first barbie doll came out in 1959."

Fry thought that Silver’s adhesive would be the ticket for a better bookmark.\nFry went to work the next day, ordered a sample of the adhesive and began coating it on paper, carefully coating only the edge of the paper so that the part protruding from his hymnal wouldn’t be sticky. Fry also realized that the bookmark could also be a note.\nIn 1978, 3Mers descended on Boise, Idaho, with samples for what would later be called the “Boise Blitz”. Boise was selected because it wasn’t too big a city.\nSamples were handed out, and 3M discovered that more than 90% of the people who tried them would buy them.\nAt the request of 3M marketers, Shirley Tholander (secretary to Lew Lehr, chairman of the 3M board) sent a letter to her executive secretary peers at Fortune 100 companies and enclosed a product sample.\nIncongruities\nAn Incongruity is an incompability - something that appears very different to the point of change.\nIn 1912, Charles Franklin Kettering invented the electric starter.\nBefore the electric starter, this boost was provided by a crank at the front of the car. Women and men of smaller stature had trouble working the crank without help. In addition, the crank was dangerous to operate, and some drivers were injured while cranking the car – this became a source of innovation.\nThe impetus for the electric starter came from a realisation of the incongruity between the demographics of car buyers versus the demographic composition of the world at large.\nWithout an easy way to start the car, car manufacturers were only selling to half2 the population!\nProcess Needs\nSBS Transit’s Iris NextBus and PostBox are good examples.\nIndustry Market and Structures\nIndustry structures can change, creating tremendous opportunities for innovation.\nIn the past, photographic film needed to be “processed” in a dark room.\nIn the digital world, processing can be self-serviced.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Outside a Company\nThese include:\n\nDemographic Changes\nThe graying of many societies is a demographic change that is looming.\nOne impact of this will be the increasing need for robots to do routine housework (and so on).\nChanges in Public Perception\nCirque du Soleil (i.e., CdS) capitalised on the changes in public perception on the use of animals in circuses (in addition, the cost of the animals and their training, medical care, housing, insurance, and transportation was very high).\nTraditional circus shows have a series of unrelated acts, but each Cirque du Soleil creation has a theme and story line, somewhat resembling a theater performance.\nNew Knowledge and Scientific Discoveries\nThere is a protracted time span between the emergence of new knowledge and its distillation into usable technology.\nThen there is another long period before this new technology appears in the marketplace in products, processes or services.\nTo become effective, innovation of this sort demands not one kind of knowledge but"

    "text": "2.5 Innovation Case Study #1: Shipping Containers\n\n\n\n\n\nA Shipping Container\n\n\n\n\nThe shipping container was invented by Malcolm Purcell McLean. MacLean was also responsible for founding pan-Atlantic services.\n\n2.5.1 Prior to the Shipping Container’s Fruition\nArmies of ill-paid and ill-treated workers called longshoremen would help unload and load supplies onto merchant ships. The whole (un)loading process would take a day - shipping costs were hence expensive (i.e., a four-thousand mile voyage for a shipment might consume about 50% of its costs for just two ten-mile movements).\n\n“In the first forty months of World War II, the U-boats sank 2,177 merchant ships totalling 11,045,284 tons, while the number of merchant ships lost to all other causes was negligible in comparison.”\n– Syrett, 1993, page 1.\n\nMany German “U-boats” (i.e., submarines) also sank many merchant ships during the Battle of the Atlantic.\nIn response to this, the US navy built more than 2400 “liberty ships” between 1941 and 1945. These ships were small enough to avoid being sunk so that little cargo would be lost if the ship was sunk.\nAfter the war, the US navy sold about 450 “liberty ships” to their merchant lines. However, these “liberty ships” were cramped and had odd dimensions - longshoremen needed to figure out how to fit cargo in these conditions. These “liberty ships” wasted time and money from the shipowners’ perspectives.\n\n2.5.1.1 More About Longshoremen\n\n\n\n\n\nLongshoremen Loading Bananas onto a Merchant Ship\n\n\n\n\nLongshoremen were individuals who saw themselve as tough, independent men who were doing a tough job. They had reputations as brawlers and drinkers.\nThe work that they did was brutal and physically dangerous, so much so that there were many injuries, and in some cases, fatalities.\nLongshoremen would also work in all sorts of weather conditions and would also compete among themselves for work. This entire process meant kickbacks, flattery, and begging. Because of this, their income was irregular and longshoremen would be loyal to their co-workers, not the company that they were working for.\nStrikes were also frequent due to poor pay and poor working conditions. In Britain alone, these strikes led to 1 million man-days lost between 1948 to 1951 and another 1.3 million in 1954. These strikes also led to two major problems:\n\nPilfering: longshoremen would end up stealing the cargo that they were supposed to load.\nResistance to anything that might eliminate jobs.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 McLean’s Background and Starting His Own Trucking Company\nMacLean was born in Maxton, North Carolina. His mother first taught him how to do business by giving him eggs to sell on commission.\nMcLean graduated from high school in 1931 and started working at a grocery store to stock shelves. He eventually became the manager of a gas station in a nearby town.\nMcLean learned that drivers were being paid $5 an hour just to transport gas to the station.\n\n2.5.2.1 McLean Trucking Company\nIn March 1934, McLean started the McLean Trucking Company. In 1935, he started off with two trucks and a truck trailer. He also employed nine truck drivers who owned their own rigs.\nIn 1940, he owned about 30 trucks and grossed about $230,000.\nIn 1945, he owned 162 trucks and in 1946, made a revenue of about $2.2 million.\nIn 1953, McLean noticed that the highways were becoming increasingly congested. He was also concerned that domestic ship lines were allowed to buy war-surplus cargo ships for a low price from the government.\nIn September 1955, McLean sold off his trucking company for about $14 million!\n\n\n\n2.5.3 McLean’s First Container Ship\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Image of the Ideal-X\n\n\n\n\nOn 26 April, 1956, 58 aluminium truck bodies were loaded aboard an ageing tanker Ideal-X that was moored in Newark, New Jersey. Ideal-X then sailed into Houston.\nOn 1 April, 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority (i.e., PSA) was formed to take over the functions, the assets, and the liabilities of the Singapore harbor board.\n\n2.5.3.1 What is a Shipping Container?\nA shipping container is an aluminum or a steel box that held up by rivets and welds - it has a wooden floor and two enormous doors at both ends.\nThe container cheapened transportation costs; it was also a part of a highly efficient and seamless system for shipping cargo across the world.\nThe container could also be loaded onto the Ideal-X in seven minutes (i.e., using a crane). The railroad and trucking business attempted to compete with McLean’s shipping containers. Between April and December, 44 voyages were created; consequently, the tanker’s capacity increased from 58 to 60 containers (before it increased to 62 containers).\n\n\n\n2.5.4 New York’s Decline\nMcLean’s containers made New York ports obsolete. During the 1920s, the trucking industry had already made New York’s ports obsolete.\nIn 1952, traffic leading to piers was so bad that pier-bound vehicles were banned from the Twelfth Avenue.\n\n\n2.5.5 Social Impact of Shipping Containers\nWhen the industry fled New York, the number of manufacturing jobs fell.\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard closed in 1966, and Brooklyn residents abandoned the borough in droves. Brooklyn’s population fell by 14% between 1971 and 1980."

He was disturbed by what he saw. He thought: “we can put people on the moon and travel to the depths of the ocean, but we cannot get a wheelchair over a curb?”\nThe more he thought about the limitations faced by people in wheelchairs - no eye-level conversations, no trips to the beach or anywhere else without sidewalks, no reaching the top shelf at the grocery, no possibility of defeating the absolute barrier of stairs - the more he became offended as an engineer\n\n2.6.1 Kamen’s Invention\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iBOT Project Started by Kamen\n\n\n\n\nFred-iBOT was a wheelchair that could roll through gravel and sand, go up curbs, and even climb stairs. It would change the lives of many.\nThe project was funded by Johnson & Johnson, but did not take off likely due to cost issues.\n\n\n2.6.2 About Dean Kamen\nHe was born in Rockville Center, Long Island, New York, in 1951. He attended college at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.\nHe also owned a business, Independent Prototype, and did a project for Cordis, a medical company, through which he met the founder, William Murphy. He made about $60,000 a year\nBart, a medical student at Harvard, suggested that he work on a drug-infusion pump.\nFrom there, Kamen started a new company - AutoSyringe - where he designed the first portable insulin pump (which freed diabetics from their condition’s limitations).\n\n2.6.2.1 Starting a Family Business\nKamen’s brother, Mitch and Mitch’s friends became assemblers for the pump.\nHis mother tested circuit boards and kept the books.\nHis father drew the illustrations for the manual.\nHe enlisted the help of Worcester Polytechnic’s students and professors to help him improve the design of his inventions.\nKamen also moved to New Hampshire to evade New York’s high taxes.\nEventually, Kamen would sell the pump to Baxter Healthcare for about $30 million in 1982 (when Kamen was 31 years old).\nKamen would then go onto buy an airplane, a helicopter, and an island in Long Island Sound. He then founded his own R&D company DEKA (i.e., short for DEan KAmen).\nKamen’s first spinoff company Teletrol installed climate control systems for large industrial and commercial buildings\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Kamen’s Attitude Regarding Failure\n\n“In study after study, of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice-skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals,” writes the neurologist Daniel Levitin, “this number comes up again and again.\nTen thousand hours is equivalent to roughly three hours a day, or 20 hours a week, of practice over 10 years …. No one has yet found a case in which true world-class expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.”\n– Dean Kamen\n\nIn 1987, Baxter Healthcare approached Kamen to improve its kidney dialysis machine - it was noisy, expensive, heavy (180 lb) and bulky!\nKamen urged his engineers not to limit themselves to what they thought was feasible, and he did not hold failures against his engineers if they learned something along the way.\nHis philosophy was that no experiments was useless."

This was a problem as not only was it difficult to oversee such a vast amount of workers, but there would also be inconsistencies with the quality of labor.\nA&G then offered a price of $75000 to anybody who could invent an automatic cigarette rolling machine.\n\n2.7.1 James Albert Bonsack\nOn September 4, 1880, Bonsack - a teenager tinkerer - got a patent for his invention. His machine could turn out about 200 to 212 cigarettes per minute (roughly 40 to 50 workers’ output).\n\n2.7.1.1 Bonsack’s Machine’s Performance\nA&G ultimately rejected the machine for the following reasons:\n\nThey feared that cigarettes were traditionally hand-crafted.\nThey feared that the machine would be too efficient, leaving them with mountains of unsold cigarettes.\nOverall managerial timidity associated with the handling of the dismissals of unneeded workers.\n\nWashington Duke and his son, James Buchanan Duke, decided to install Bonsack’s machine in their factories. In 1889, Duke & Sons sold a billion cigarettes, and in 1890, formed the American Tobacco Company,\nThe machines brought about a tremendous reduction in the cost of manufacturing cigarettes.\nBy 1884, the Bonsack Machine was producing from 100,000 to 120,000 cigarettes per day, the equivalent of the production of forty to fifty hand workers.\nDuke, like other producers, initially overcame any popular prejudice against the machines in a very simple way: he used them in the greatest secrecy and the public remained unaware of their widespread application for years.\nThe Duke company began to produce most of its cigarettes by machine in 1885, encountering little of the consumer resistance its rivals had anticipated. Duke’s application of the Bonsack Machines revolutionized the business of making cigarettes; the profits of the Duke company rose during subsequent years.\nThis was also what happened to Leica."

Furious mobs also destroyed 40 customs post in the 18-mile wall surrounding Paris.\nBecause of this, France was bankrupt - the king didn’t know what to do and debts rose in England’s favor.\n\n3.2.1 8 August, 1788\nKing Louis XVI summoned the Estate General - something that hadn’t been done in 175 years (i.e., not since 1614).. The Estate General represents the three general orders of French society: clergy, nobility, and commoners.\nThere only about 500000 clergy and nobility in the Estate General and about 27 million commoners.\nNonetheless, Louis XVI ordered the Estate Geneal to form a cahiers de doléances, a notebook of grievances. One of the items was a reform of weights and measures.\n\n\n3.2.2 Formation of the National Assembly\nOn June 17, 1789, the deputies of the third estate (i.e., the nation) were locked out of the meeting hall at Versailles. They thought that that was Louis XVI’s way of forcing them to disband.\nInstead, the deputies had a meeting at a nearby tennis court - they swore to never disband until France had a written constitution.\n\n\n3.2.3 14 July, 1789\nLouis XVI let his finance minister Jacques Necker go. Necker was sympathetic to the third estate and was hailed as a reformer by the people.\nOn the same day, a large crowd bursted into the Invalides (i.e., old soldiers’ home and weapons depot) and carried 30,000 muskets and fire cannons. They also raided the bastille for gunpowder - by the end, the Invalides was theirs (with about 170 casualties).\n\n\n3.2.4 5 and 6 October, 1789\nA crowd of women (i.e., fishwives, stallkeepers, harlots, and seamstresses) marched towards the Versailles with weapons (e.g., cudgels, scythes, etc.) and demanded bread.\nOn the next morning, they found an open side gate and burst into the palace. With the heads of two guards impaled on a spike, they escorted the royal family to Paris and left them in the Tuileres Palace.\n\n\n3.2.5 21 June , 1791\nLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette slipped out of the Tuileres in servants’ disguise for a 200-mile dash to Austrian territory (that was overseen by Marie’s brother). However, a postmaster identified Louis and the couple was arrested and bought back to Paris. Both people were found guilty of treason.\nOn 21 September, 1792, the monarchy was abolished.\nLouis XVI was beheaded on 21 January, 1793 - his body was dumped in an anonymous grave.\nMarie Antoinette was beheaded on 16 October, 1793; her body was taken to a graveyard behind the Church of Medeline. However, the gravediggers were on a lunch break.\nThis opportunity gave Marie Groscholtz (later known as Madame Tussaud) enough time to make a was figure of her face.\n\n\n3.2.6 France’s Measurement Situation\n\n“Contemporaries estimated that under the cover of some eight hundred names, ancient regime France contained a staggering 250,000 different units of weights and measures.”\n– Alder, 2002, p. 3\n\nMany quantities were named as such because of their origins from human needs and interests.\nThe Greeks and Romans used fingers as a base measurement - a “foot”’s length is about the same as a human foot. The cubit foot was about as long as an arm’s bend at the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Because of this, the following measurements were fashioned:\n\n1 foot = 16 fingers\n1 cubit = 24 fingers\n\nAnthropometric measures also reflected the amount of labor that a person could do in one sitting. Coal was measured in charge and was equivalent to about \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of a miner’s daily output. Arable land was measured in “homme” or “journee” to estimate the amount of land that a peasant might be able to plough in a day."

    "section": "3.3 Implications of the Metric System",
    "text": "3.3 Implications of the Metric System\nThere were many different kinds of implications (to different disciplines) when the metric system was introduced.\n\n3.3.1 Religious Implications\n\n“You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment regarding measures in length, weight, or quantity. You shall have honest balances, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.”\n– Leviticus, 19:35-36\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scientific Implications\nScientists argued that such a system should also proclaim universal measures (just as how the French revolution would also proclaim universal rights for all).\nScientists also derived the fundamental unit from the measure of the word itself.\n\n3.3.2.1 Fundamental Unit\nThe “unit of length” was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance along the meridian through Paris from the North Pole to the Equator.\nThe “meter” would be eternal as it was taken from the Earth itself (which was believed to be eternal). It was also equally belong to all people of the world as the Earth also belonged to each individual equally.\nAn alternative idea was that a fundamental unit of length could also be derived from the length of a pendulum beating one second. This was an idea that dated back to the 17th century when Galileo demonstrated that the period of a pendulum’s beat was determined by its length.\nHowever, the length of a one-second pendulum was also sensitive to the latitude at which it was measured, because gravity varied slightly with latitude. The equator may have been a suitable choice, but it was also quite remote from scientific nations; hence, the second most natural location would be 45\\(^\\circ\\) of north latitude - at the outskirts of Bordeaux in south-west France. However, the idea did not meet with international approval.\n\n3.3.2.1.1 Refinements to the System\nAuguste-Savinien Leblond - a French mathematician - coined the word “meter” (which came from the Greek word “metron”) for the fundamental unit of length.\nGreek prefixes were used for multiple measures of the meter and Latin prefixes for submultiples. This idea was proposed by Claude Antoine Prieur.\nFor a brief period of time, these prefixes scared people, so they were replaced with ordinary names (e.g., “decimeter” would used to be called a palme).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Meridian Expedition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meridian on the Globe\n\n\n\n\nThe meridian is an imaginary north-south line on the Earth’s surface that connects both geographic poles. It is used to indicate longitude.\nIn June 1792, two astronomers - Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre and Pierre-François-André Méchain - went in opposite directions from Paris to measure a piece of the meridian arc that ran from Dunkirk to Barcelona through Paris.\nThey did this to establish a common standard of measure that people of all sorts could use it.\n\n3.3.3.1 Geodesy\nGeodesy is the science of measuring and understanding Earth’s properties - its shape, its gravity, its orientation in space - as well as how these properties change over time.\nVia GPS, many geodesists can measure the movement of a site 24 hours per day, seven days a week.\nGeodesy on a smaller scale is called surveying.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Standard for Mass\nAntoine Lavoisier and the crystallographer René-Just Haüy worked on the grave - the kilogram as it was previously called - as a cubic decimeter of rainwater weighed in a vacuum at the melting point of ice (i.e., 0\\(^\\circ\\)C).\nIn 1799, the chemist Lefèvre-Gineau would define the “gram” as a cubic centimeter of rainwater in a vacuum at the temperature of maximum density.\n\n\n3.3.5 First International Scientific Conference\nTwo months before Méchain and Delambre finished their measurements, foreign representatives arrived in Paris to attend the Congress on Definitive Metric Standards. This happened on 28 November 1798.\nThe instruments used for the preliminary work was inspected and tested in field observations. The representatives were asked to propagate the new system in their own countries.\n\n3.3.5.1 Adopting the Meter\nWhen the meter was introduced in France, it caused confusion. The system disrupted norms and opened local markets to outside competitions. Even physicians were afraid that they would have to re-learn all their dosages.\nNapoleon Bonaparte refused to learn the system - he insisted that the weights he got be restated in poids de marc (i.e., old-style pounds) as he could not “think” in the new units.\nEventually, a legislation passed in 1873 that would mandate the metric system mandatory throughout France and its colones from 1840 onwards.\n\n\n\n3.3.6 World Metrology Day\nThe meter convention was signed on 20 May, 1875 by representatives from the following nations:\n\nArgentina\nAustria\nBelgium\nBrazil\nDenmark\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nPeru\nPortugal\nRussia\nSpain\nSweden and Norway\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUSA\nVenezuela\n\nThis day also mandated the establishment of a permanent International Bureau of Weights and Measures (i.e., BIPM: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to be located in Sèvres, France.\nThis annivesary is now known as World Metrology Day."

One day would have 10 decimal hours, an hour 100 decimal minutes, and a decimal minute 100 decimal seconds.\nThis was an idea that got introduced during the French revolution during October 5, 1793.\nWatchmakers would design prototype clocks that pointed to “V o’clock” at midday and at “X o’clock” midnight.\nOther alternatives were also proposed:\n\nJoseph Charles François de Rey-Pailhade suggested dividing the day into 100 parts, each called cé, for “centiday”.\nHenri de Sarrauton defined the hour as the fundamental unit and divided it into 100 decimal minutes.\n\nHowever, decimal time was dropped shortly after for the following reasons:\n\nIt had no significant advantage over the previous system\nPeople would become confused\nPeople were too used to the old timing system\nMaking new clocks and watches would be too costly\nWatchmakers would be unable to dispose of their old stock\n\n\n3.4.1 Definitions of Time\nAt the 13th official meeting in 1967, the committee adopted the following definition:\n\n“The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom”\n– The committee\n\nIn 1972, the committee would then introduce the leap second to take care of small irregularities in the rotation of the Earth."

The Franc was the Western world’s first brush with decimalized currency.\n\n3.5.1 Decimal Angles\nA 400\\(^\\circ\\) circle would not only ease calculations, but also unify astronomy and navigation.\nIn a world where the quarter meridian was ten million meters long, each degree would measure a hundred kilometers (hence simplifying maps and helping sailors).\n\n\n3.5.2 Consequences of Measuring Mix-Ups\nIn September 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter - a USD 125 million, 338 kilogram robotic space probe launched by NASA to study Martian climate and atmosphere - burned up and broke into pieces after 10 months of travel.\nThe navigation team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory used metric systems, while Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, Colorado provided acceleration data in inches, feet, and pounds."

Authors and editors can also help do the aforementioned via starting a document with a meaningful title and a well-prepared abstract.\nHowever, authors should also bear in mind that people may only selectively read parts of the paper (i.e., not just the abstract).\n\n\n\nAn abstract is a brief, objective representation of a document or an oral source’s contents. Its purpose to allow readers to identify what a document will be about, to determine a document’s relevance to their motives, and to decide what it is that they will need to read from the document.\nThe purpose of ANSI Z39.14 is to guide authors and staff of service access services on how to prepare an abstract that is as useful as possible.\nANSI Z39.14 applies to all abstracts regardless of author(s), publication location, or publication style (e.g., oral presentations and written documents).\n\n\n\nThe document uses some terms that may be unfamiliar to the layperson:\n\nAbstract\nA brief and objective representation of a document or an oral presentation.\nAnnotation\nA brief explanation of a document and its contents (usually as a note).\nCritical Abstract\nAn uncommon form of an abstract that contains evaluations on the significance of a kind of material or a material’s presentation.

The kind of document should not be stated in the first sentence of an abstract.\nActive Verbs\nActive voice should be used whenever possible. Passive voice may be used for indicative and for informative statements (for which the receiver of the action should be emphasized).\nVocabulary\nUnfamiliar jargon should be avoided.\nNon-Textual Material\nThey should only be included when necessary and when no other alternative is possible.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main kinds:\n\n\nInformative abstracts are used for documents for experimental investigations, inquiries, or surveys. The abstracts of these documents state the document’s purpose, methodology, results, and conclusions.\nThe structure of an informative abstract may be changed depending on the kind of document and its audience.\nIn a structured abstract (i.e., a structured informative abstract), major points of text are shown in several, labelled paragraphs instead of one.\n\n\n\nIndicative abstracts are used for less-structured documents (e.g., editorials, essays, opinions, or descriptions) or for lengthy documents (e.g., books, directories, and lists).\nSuch abstracts are used for documents that do not have information pertaining to methodologies or results. However, the abstract should still describe the purpose or the scope of discussion or descriptions within a document.\nThe abstract may also discuss any crucial background information."

Most supplements do not prevent chronic disease or death - hence, their use is not justified (i.e., they should be avoided)."
