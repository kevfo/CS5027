    "text": "1.1 Singapore’s Past\n\n“A nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade, regardless of its mechanical skill.”\n– Bush, 1945\n\nWhen Singapore separated from Malaysia, its focus was put on survival as it was a nation with no natural resources. One such tool that would enable Singapore to survive was through Science: a necessary pre-requisite for industrial and technological advancement.\nIn February 1966, Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye1 announced a proposal for forming a new statutory board: the Science Council of Singapore.\n\n1.1.1 Science Council of Singapore (i.e., SCS)\nThis board was established in 1967 - the board would make reports and suggest recommendations on:\n\nScientific and technological research and developments.\nEffective training and utilization of scientific and technological manpower in Singapore.\nEstablishing official relations with other scientific organizations.\n\nIn 1968, the board suggested establishing a science center in Singapore - this was suggested to the Minister of Science and Technology.\nShortly after, a special committee was appointed to come up with the preparatory work and submit proposals for setting up the center - this committee included:\n\nA chairman: Ronald Sng Ewe Min\nThree members:\n\nSng Yew Chong\nRex Anthony Shelley\nBernard Tan Tiong Gie\n\n\n\n1.1.1.1 Science and Industry Quiz (i.e., SIQ)\nThe SCS thought that one way to popularize science and technology over the television would be to combine education with entertainment.\nSecondary school students would form teams and participate in the SIQ. Each team would have four members: two members would participate in the quiz programme and the other two on standby.\nThere are two rounds to the SIQ:\n\nPreliminary Round\nAll competing teams had two sets of question papers: Set A and Set B.\nSet A had 100 questions; Set B had 50 questions. Each team had 15 minutes to answer both sets.\nThe first preliminary round was held at the Raffles Institution Hall on 28 July, 1972. 54 Teams competed, but only 12 were selected for the Televised Series.\nTelevised Series\nThere were three stages - the four Quarter Finals, two Semi-Finals, and a Final.\nEach of the televised series had four rounds. The first round was where each team would have a fixed amount of time to answer as many questions as they could.\nThe second round consisted of questions being asked to each individual of a team. The question had to be answered within a minute and with no assistance.\nRound three posed a question to all team members - the team had to answer the question unanimously. The six questions posed in this round enabled problem-solving and teamwork skills.\nThe fourth final round was a buzzer-style question triva session.\n\n\n\n1.1.1.2 The Innovators\nIn 1979, the SIQ was replaced by The Innovators.\nThe Innovators was a series of six programs where JC2 students would work with Radio Television Singapura producers to produce television programs that had a scientific or technological theme, but focused on innovation.\nThe top three programs included:\n\n“…And Life Goes On”\n“Food Encounters”\n“The Miracle Gene”\n\nThese three programs were selected by a panel of judges - the student producers were awarded prizes too.\n\n\n1.1.1.3 Opening of the Science Center\n\n“While formal educational institutions make sure we are raising a nation of “science literate people”, Science Centre Singapore takes this to the next level.\nWe make science accessible and engaging, creating an environment where Singaporeans are empowered to advance their own learning and, hopefully, are inspired to do something incredible with their futures.\nAdmission (just to the Science Centre) is $6 for adults and $4 for children.”\n– Science Center’s justification\n\nThe Science Center aimed to be a place where “Science befriends and transforms the minds of millions”.\n\n\n\n\n\nEntrance to Singapore’s Science Center\n\n\n\n\nIt also aimed to promote interest, learning, and creativity in science and technology via imaginative and enjoyable experiences (that contribute to Singapore’s human resources).\n\n1.1.1.3.1 Redeveloping the Science Center\n\n“Many people whom I have spoken to remember the Science Center fondly, and can even name specific exhibits that have inspired them. The new Science Centre gives us an opportunity to do even more – to help our young learn through play and fun, to inculcate a love and wonder for science and technology among Singaporeans and to kindle a passion for lifelong learning and inquiry.”\n– Mr. Koh\n\nThe above was mentioned by Koh Boon Hwee during 12 November, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 National Science and Technology Board (i.e., NSTB)\nThis was formed in October 1990 (after the passing of the bill); and the enactment of the Science and Technology Board act the following month.\nThe NSTB was a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade & Industry (i.e., MTI).\nThe NSTB developed Singapore into a center of excellence in certain fields of science and technology to enhance national competitiveness in industrial and service sectors (i.e., industry-driven research and development).\n\n1.1.2.1 A*STAR\nOn 5 January 2002, the NSTB was reorganized and renamed to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (i.e., A*STAR).\n\n\n\n\n\nA*STAR’s Homepage\n\n\n\n\nA*STAR aimed to promote mission-oriented research that advances scientific discovery and technological innovations.\nThe agency got a portion of the national science and technology’s budget as a show of support. Its facilities are currently located at Biopolis and Fusionopolis (at one-north).\n\n1.1.2.1.1 A*STAR’s Mission\nA*STAR aims to develop Singapore’s science, technology, and engineering capabilities to boost Singapore’s economic growth via the three ways:\n\nDeveloping the manpower required for the science and technology sectors.\nPioneering research and development to drive innovation and enhance the Singapore’s knowledge-based economy.\nMonetizing results in research and development.\n\nRegarding the final point, A*STAR’s commercialization arm manages its intellectual property and also helps apply its research to industry.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (i.e., LKCNHM)\nThe LKCNHM - formerly known as the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (i.e., RMBR) - was opened on 18 April, 2015 by Dr. Tony Tan Keng Yun: the president and chancellor of the National University of Singapore.\nThe museum strives to be a leader in Southeast Asian biodiversity in research, education, and outreach.\nMrs. Della Lee3 donated enough money to enable LKCNHM to purchase three dinosaur skeletons.\n\n\n1.1.4 NUS High School of Mathematics and Science\nThe school’s mission was to shape the future of education in mathematics and science by producing future-ready pioneers, humanitarians, and innovators for the world.\nThe school’s motto is: Experiment. Explore. Excel.\n\n\n1.1.5 Singapore National Academy of Sciences (i.e., SNAS)\nIn 31 July, 1967, scientists collectively formed the SNAS - a scholarly and professional body. The SNAS was meant to become the equivalent of the UK’s Royal Society or the USA’s National Academy of Sciences.\nThe SNAS was formed with the following objectives:\n\nPromoting the advancement of science and technology in Singapore\nDiscussing scientific, technological, and macroeconomic problems (especially those that concern the nation)\nRepresenting members’ scientific opinions and fellows of the academy"

    "text": "1.2 Singapore’s Return on Investment\nThis sub-section discusses some of Singapore’s results with regards to its investment in science and technology.\n\n1.2.1 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (i.e., TIMSS)\nThe TIMSS is developed and executed at the international level by the International Association for the Evaluation of Education Assessment (i.e., IEA).\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s TIMSS Results in Science\n\n\n\n\nThe TIMSS happens once every four years (the latest one was in 2019) - Singapore has partook in every study.\n\n1.2.1.1 Scope of the TIMSS\nThe TIMSS gauges the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth and eighth graders (i.e., primary four and secondary 2 respectively). However, some countries only participate at the eighth-grade level.\nThe TIMSS allows for an international benchmark in three bands and along two dimensions - content and cognitive domains:\n\nAverage is higher than the US’\nAverage score is not measurably different from the US’\nAverage score is lower than the US’\n\nResults may wildly differ between countries, but the reasons are attributed to students’ attitudes, educational aspirations, school climates (e.g., violence in schools), school resources, and safety.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Programme for International Student Assessment (e.g., PISA)\nThe PISA is a study done once every three years and is run by the Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (i.e., OECD).\nSingapore’s 15-year olds were ranked first in mathematics, science, and reading in 2015 (i.e., Singaporean students were the best in the world when it comes to working in teams to solve problems).\nHence, Singaporean students are very well equipped for the future’s opportunities and challenges - they have a high ability to work well independently and together.\nIn 2018, Singapore came in second place in all three categories (China took first place).\n\n\n1.2.3 Times Higher Education (i.e., THE) University Rankings\nIn 2019, NTU and NUS were ranked 51 and 23 on the THE world university rankings.\n\n\n\n\n\nQS Rankings for NTU and NUS in 2019\n\n\n\n\nThe Quacquarelli Symonds (i.e., QS) rankings ranked NTU and NUS at 12 and 11 respectively - SMU was ranked at 500. Both NTU and NUS were ranked at 11 in the QS rankings in 2020 - SMU was at 477.\n\n\n1.2.4 President’s Science and Technology Award (i.e., PSTA)\nThe PSTA recognizes individuals with creative ideas who have made significant contributions to Singapore.\nSo far, over 60 men and women who have been singled out for this.\n\n\n1.2.5 International Olympiads\nThis following sub sub-section lists Singapore’s performances in the International Olympiads:\n\nMath\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Math Olympiad (i.e., IMO)\n\n\n\n\nThe first math olympiad (i.e., IMO) was held in 1959 in Romania with 7 countries’ participants. Over the years, 100 counries from five continents have participated.\nThe competition is overseen by the IMO board - they also ensure that each host country upholds the traditions of the IMO.\nInformatics\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Olympiads in Informatics (i.e, IOI)\n\n\n\n\nThe IOI is an annual competitive programming competition for secondary school students - the first IOI happened in 1989 in Pravetz, Bulgaria.\nThe contest consists of two days of computer programming and problem-solving in algorithms.\nBiology\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Biology Olympiad (i.e., IBO)\n\n\n\n\nThe IBO is a competition that tackles Biological problems and deals with Biological experiments (i.e., testing them). The IBO challenges and stimulates participants to expand their talents and to promote participants’ careers as scientists.\nChemistry\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the 30th International Chemistry Olympiad (i.e., IChO)\n\n\n\n\nThe IChO is an annual Chemistry for a nation’s most talented high-schoolers. Nations send a team of four students who are tested on their Chemistry knowledge and skills in a five-hour laboratory practical and five-hour written theoretical examination that are both held on different days.\nYoung Physicists’ Tournament\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore’s Performance in the International Young Physicists’ Tournament (i.e., IYPT)\n\n\n\n\nThe IYPT (sometimes called the “Physics World Cup”) is a team-oriented competition for secondary school students.\nParticipants present their solutions to scientific problems they have prepared over several months and then discuss their solutions with other teams.\nAstronomy and Astrophysics (i.e., IOAA)\nThe IOAA promotes interest in astronomy and similar subjects by developing “international contacts” between different schools to promote Astronomy and Astrophysics in schools.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Singapore’s Scientific Pioneers\n\n\n\n\n\nA Book on Singapore’s Scientific Pioneers\n\n\n\n\nThe book shown above contains information on 25 individuals who laid foundations for Singapore’s scientific achievements.\nAll of these scientists were born prior to Singapore’s independence, but have made exceptional contributions to Singapore’s engineering, medical, educational, and scientific sectors.\nSome of these people include:\n\nBenjamin Henry Sheares\nHe was the father of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Singapore. He has a procedure named after him and was one of the top graduates of the King Edward VII College of Medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shears Bridge in Singapore\n\n\n\n\nHe was also Singapore’s second president - he also has a bridge named after him: the Benjamin Sheares Bridge (which is one of Singapore’s most famous landmarks).\nShih Choong Fong\nShih was the president of NUS from 2000 to 2008 and also the founding president for King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (i.e., KAUST) in from 2008 to 2013.\nShih got a PhD from Harvard in 1973 and led the Fracture Research Group at the GE Corporate Research Lab in the US. In 1981, he joined Brown University. He was appointed University Professor by NUS in 2013 and was inducted into the Honorary Membership by NUSS in 2001.\nTay Eng Soon\nSoon was more well-known as a politician. He was a minister of state in the Ministry of Education from 1980 until he died in 1993.\nSoon worked hard to develop polytechnics and ITEs.\nHis speciality was in nuclear energy and nuclear power."

    "section": "1.3 What is Science?",
    "text": "1.3 What is Science?\n\n“Science is a voyage of intellectual exploration, and an expression of the human spirit.”\n– Henry Stommel, 1989\n\nIn 1834, William Whewell4 (1794 - 1866) coined the term “scientist”5.\nHe was also the master of of Trinity College at Cambridge; he was also a founding member and a president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n1.3.1 Scientific Worldview\nThe world is seen as such by a scientist:\n\nThe world is understandable\nScientific ideas can change\nScientific knowledge is everlasting\nScience cannot answer everything\nScience is an enterprise\n\nScience is a blend of logic and imagination - logic is used to understand why things happen while one’s creativity is used to recognize the meaning of something unexpected.\n\n1.3.1.1 The World is Understandable\nStuff that happens in this world have a consistent pattern that can be seen through close observation.\nBy using one’s intellect along with instruments, people can find all sorts of patterns.\nThe universe is a system where the basic rules are the same.\n\n\n1.3.1.2 Scientific Ideas can Change\nNew observations can challenge existing theories, in which case, new theories may be needed to explain the observation.\nScience is humanity’s attempt at explaining how the universe works.\nTesting, improving, and discarding theories is an ongoing process in Science.\n\n\n1.3.1.3 Scientific Knowledge is Everlasting\nModifying ideas (instead of rejecting them) is a norm in science. Powerful constructs survive and grow more precise so that they are more widely accepted.\nEinstein did not reject the Newtonian law of motion, but only showed them to be a limited application with a more general concept.\n\n\n1.3.1.4 Science Cannot Answer Everything\nMany beliefs fall into this category (e.g., supernatural forces, true purpose of life, etc).\nIn some cases, science may even be seen as irrelevant by people hwo have certain beliefs (e.g., fortune tellers)\n\n\n1.3.1.5 Science is an Enterprise\nScience is a complex, social activity that involves many individuals of many backgrounds.\nScientific research is also competitive in that researchers compete for funding - committees meet up to decide which topic(s) should be focused on.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Components of Science\nScience has certain elements:\n\n1.3.2.1 Scientific Enquiry\nScience demands evidence; scientists focus on collecting accurate data (which are verified by others).\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Making Observations\nTo make observations, scientists must use:\n\nTheir five senses\nInstruments that enhance those senses\nInstruments that go beyond the human senses\n\n\n\n1.3.2.3 Attitudes\nScientists need to be willing to work hard, to have courage, and to embrace openness (i.e., be willing to change).\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Ways of Observation\nScientists…\n\nObserve passively (i.e., watch things happen without interefering)\nMake collections (i.e., collecting samples)\nActively probe the world (e.g., conducting clinical trials, etc).\n\nOtherwise, they also…\n\nExplain and Predict\nScientists use observations to construct explanations for them.\nThese hypotheses should also fit additional observations.\nIdentify and Avoid Bias\nScientific evidence can be biased in how scientists choose to report those facts (or the kind of data collected to begin with).\nA scientist’s nationality, sex, age, and other factors may cause them to look for one kind of evidence or interpretation.\nA possible safeguard against this is to have many different people involved working on the same problem.\nRealize that nobody is omniscient (i.e., all-knowing)\nNo scientist had the right to decide for themselves what is “true”.\nScientist whose observations do not align with mainstream ideas may encounter vigorous criticisms - these scientists may also have difficulty garnering support for their research.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Creative-Failure Methodology\n\n“A basic truth that the history of the creation of the transistor reveals is that the foundations of transistor electronics were created by making errors and following hunches that failed to give what was expected.”\n– William Shockley\n\nWilliam Shockley - inventor of the transistor - started with a concept of the tubeless radio and used trial and error to make his invention.\n\n\n1.3.5 Communication and Organization in Science\nScience can be communicated in a variety of ways, some of which include:\n\nCommunicating with the Public\nScience is too important for the public to stay in the lab.\nMany scientists too feel a need to inform the public about potentially dangerous misconceptions or to counter misinformation from numerous quarters.\n\nScience is also organized into content disciplines - it is a collection of scientific fields (that provide a foundation of research).\nDifferent fields in science also spill into one another (e.g., Biochemistry, Biophysics, etc).\n\n\n1.3.6 A “Right” Way to Perform Science\nThere are ethical principles to conducting science - competition has led to unethical practices such as:\n\nScientists withholding information and falsifying findings\nThese violations damage science, the scientific community, and the funding agencies.\nTreating live subjects\nFor instance, human subjects should only be used for a study if they consent to it. Part of this also means disclosing the risks and intended benefits of research.\nScientists as Experts and Advisors\nScientists partake in public affairs as specialists and as citizens.\nScientists help the public and its representatives to help understand what most likely happened.\n\n\n\n1.3.7 Why is Science so Important?\nScience is so important (and specialised) that the President of the United States has a 25-member panel, known as the “National Science Board” to serve as advisors to him and the Congress on policy matters related to science and engineering, and education in both fields.\nThe National Science Board has its members drawn from industry and academia. Vannevar Bush was the first Presidential Science Advisor, and also head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). He oversaw most of America’s scientific research during World War II.\n\n\n1.3.8 Science in Courtrooms\nAn increasing number of legal disputes involve the principles and tools of science. Properly resolving those disputes matters not just to the litigants, but also to the general public – those who live in our technologically complex society and whom the law must serve.\nThe decisions of the judges should reflect a proper scientific and technical understanding so that the law can respond to the needs of the public"

    "text": "1.5 Technology\nTechnology extends our abilities to change the world: to cut, shape, or put together materials; to reach farther with our hands, voices, and senses.\nWe use technology to try to change the world to suite us better The changes may relate to survival needs such as food, shelter, or defense, or they may relate to human aspirations such as knowledge, art, or control.\nBut the results of changing the world are often complicated and unpredictable.\nThey can include unexpected benefits, costs, or risks.\n\n1.5.1 Is it Practical?\nEngineering combines scientific enquiry and practical values In its broadest sense, engineering consists of construing a problem and designing a solution for it.\nEngineering shares many characteristics with science, but engineering affects the social system and culture more directly than scientific research.\n\n1.5.1.1 There is No Perfect Design\nThere is no perfect design as accommodating one constraint leads to conflict with another.\nAll technologies involve control, e.g., in an iron (or an air-conditioned room, or a rice cooker), the temperature is controlled within a preset range.\nControl typically requires feedback, logical comparisons, and a means for activating change\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Side Effects\nTechnologies have side effects  what is one side effect of X-ray? personal computers? mobile phones? the Internet? photocopy machines? the automobile? social media?\nSystematic risk analysis is used to minimise the impact of side effects (e.g., the side effect of X-ray is cancer)\nThere may also be unintended benefits / consequences:\n\nSuntan lotion\nThe main ingredient, titanium dioxide, mixed with water, results in hydrogen peroxide. This kills phytoplankton that nourishes fish and ultimately poisons the rest of the food chain.\n\nTechnology can also fail too (e.g., crashing of the space shuttle).\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Issues in Technology\nIssues have also emerged  overuse of fossil fuels, pollution, global warming, new bacterial strains that are resistant to antibiotics, digital divide, deforestation, extinction of plants and animals, strain on the soil and water systems, and more.\n\n1.5.2.1 Pseudoscience\nIn prescientific times, any attempt to harness nature mean forcing nature against her will, Nature had to be subjugated, usually with some form of magic, or by means that were “above” nature – that is, supernatural.\nScience does the exact opposite, it works “within” nature’s laws. The methods of science have largely displaced reliance on the supernatural.\nThe old ways persist, full force in primitive cultures, and they survive in technologically advanced societies too, usually disguised as science.\n\n1.5.2.1.1 No Science! Column\nIn his book, Flim-Flam!, James Randi reported that more than 20,000 practising astrologers in the United States serve millions of credulous believers.\nScience writer Martin Gardner reports that a greater percentage of Americans today believe in astrology and occult phenomena than did citizens of medieval Europe.\nFew newspapers print a daily science column, but nearly all provide daily horoscopes.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.2 Science Denialism\n\nDenialism refers to “the employment of rhetorical arguments to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none, an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists”.\n– CS5027 Course Material\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Consequence of Thabo Mbeki’s Science Denialism\n\n\n\n\nThabo Mbeki’s (the second president of South Africa) denial of science has led to the deaths of many people."

A scientist is used to represent a particular kind of research1.\n\n2.1.1 Bohr’s Quadrant\nResearch here is done for the sake of discovery (i.e., for knowledge purposes).\nThere is no attention to the research’s practicality\n\n\n2.1.2 Edison’s Quadrant\n\n“Edison never allowed himself or those working with him in Menlo Park five minutes to consider the underlying side of the significance of what they were discovering in their headlong rush toward commercial illumination.\nThe value and even the mark of true science consists, in my opinion, in the useful inventions which can be derived from it.”\n– Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n\nResearch in this quadrant is done for the sake of applications. When Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, he wasn’t interested in the science behind the device, but the potential applications and revenue that could be generated from the light bulb.\n\n\n2.1.3 Pasteur’s Quadrant\nThis quadrant was a mix of both Bohr’s and Edison’s quadrants: research in this quadrant was a mix of both practical applications and discovering new knowledge.\nPasteur not only studied the disease that was ruining southern France’s silkworm industry, but also anthrax, rabies, and fermentation and brewing in the beer industry."

    "section": "2.3 Types of Innovation",
    "text": "2.3 Types of Innovation\n\n“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”\n– Steve Jobs\n\n\n“Leave the beaten track occasionally and dive into the woods. Every time you do so you will be certain to find something that you have never seen before.”\n– Bell Labs’ Motto\n\nAn innovation is a series of activities that begin when an idea is conceived. This idea then undergoes a series of research, development, engineering, design, market analysis, management decision making, and so on before ending at product realization.\nInnovations are like creations and exploitations of new flowers.\n\n“Innovations, like flowers, start from tiny seeds and have to be nurtured carefully until they blossom, then their essence has to be carried elsewhere for the flowers to spread.\nInnovations can grow wild, springing up weed-like despite unfavourable circumstances.\nAnd some conditions - soil, climate, fertilizer, the layout of the garden - produce larger and more abundant flowers.”\n– Professor himself\n\nInnovations can be broadly divided into several categories:\n\nProduct Innovations\nThis is the introduction of a good or a service that is new or is significantly improved in some way (i.e., technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness, or other functional characteristics).\nSuch innovations can be based on new ideas and technologies (or a combination of existing and new ideas and technologies).\nProcess Innovations\nThese are the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method (which often includes changes in techniques, equipment, and / or software).\nSuch innovations are often made to decrease unit costs, to increase quality, or to produce or deliver significantly improved products.\nThese innovations also deal with the steps in making a product.\nService Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nService Kiosks at McDonalds’\n\n\n\n\nThese are intangible methods of serving users at a new level of performance - for instance, new service concepts.\nRadical Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MP3 Logo\n\n\n\n\nThese are big and major changes in products.\nThe MP3 audio system is one major example. Prior to the invention of MP3, music was listened to communally.\nIncremental Innovations\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition from Mentos Mint Candy to Mentos Caramels\n\n\n\n\nThese apply existing knowledge to improve products.\n\n\n2.3.1 Innovation as Work\nInnovation is the work of knowing, not doing. It’s also an effort to purposeful, forced change in an enterprise’s economic or social position.\n\n“I am not pleading with you to make changes. I am telling you you have got to make them – not because I say so, but because old Father Time will take care of you if you don’t change. Advancing waves of other people’s progress sweep over the unchanging man and wash him out. Consequently, you need to organise a department of systematic change-making.”\n– Charles F. Kettering\n\nInnovation requires knowledge, ingenuity, and boldness. If a person lacks persistence and commitment, then talent, knowledge, and ingenuity will not be useful.\n\n“Businessmen go down with their businesses because they like the old way so well they cannot bring themselves to change. One sees them all about - men who do not know that yesterday is past, and who woke up this morning with their last year’s ideas.”\n– Henry Ford\n\nInnovation is a specific function of entrepreneurship, whether that be in the form of an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by an individual.\n\n\n2.3.2 Characteristics of Innovation\nKanter (1998) suggested the following traits of most, if not all innovations:\n\nUncertainty\nSources of innovation may be unpredictable - the goal of innovation may have little to base itself off of.\nInnovations make progress in spurts in unforseen moments.\nA Long Journey\nThe costs of innovation may overrun and the results are highly uncertain.\nAnalysts have estimated that it may take years for a business to see any returns on their innovations.\nKnowledge-Intensive\nThe innovation process generates new knowledge and in doing so, uses human intelligence and creativity. This learning curve is steep.\nEfforts during innovation are vulnerable to leaving because of the loss of knowledge and experience (i.e.,\nControversial\nInnovations are always competitive - they provide an alternative course of action.\nOn several occassions, an innovation may be a threat to peoples’ interests (whether that “interest” be a salesperson receiving high commissions or whatnot).\nPolitical problems are often the primary cause for the failure of new venture departments in corporations.\nImperialistic\nAn innovation is also capable of crossing boundaries.\nThere is also evidence that the best ideas or interdisciplinary (i.e., they benefit from broader perspectives and from information outside of the idea responsible for the innovation).\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Example #1: Scrabble\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople Playing Scrabble\n\n\n\n\nIn 1931, Alfred Mosher Butts was a young, out-of-work architect who was seeking a means of making money.\nButts was interested in anagrams and crossword puzzles (i.e., his source of inspiration) - after further analysis, he found that games of his generation fell into one of three categories:\n\nNumber-based games\nMove-based games\nWord-based games\n\nHe eventually created a game that used a grid and words. Butts wanted his game to have both skill and luck (with a stronger emphasis on skill). Butts also realized that of the 26 characters in the alphabet, that not all of them were used frequently.\nTo find out the relative frequencies, he painstakingly studied the front pages of the New York Times, doing letter-by-letter counts (i.e., innovation is knowledge-intensive).\nThis enabled Butts to assign values to each letter in his game.\nFrom 1932 to 1938, Butts made the sets by hand and gave them to friends; most game manufacturers in the US turned down Butts’ idea.\nIn 1943, Butts met marketing genius James Brunot - Brunot made some refinements to Butts’ game.\nEventually, Brunot and his wife made an agreement with Selchow & Righter, a much more established game manufacturer to make the game (as Brunot could not keep up with game production himself).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Irish Scrabble Association\n\n\n\n\nBy 1954, more than 4 million sets of the game had been sold; the game was also available in other languages (e.g., Spanish, Italian, French, etc).\nIn 1972, Selchow & Righter purchased the game and trademarked “Scrabble”.\nHasbro now supports the National Scrabble Association (It was formerly Coleco, but they went bankrupt).\n\n\n2.3.4 Example #2: Barbie Dolls\n\n\n\n\n\nA Barbie Doll Holding a Plastic Video Recorder\n\n\n\n\nIn 1956, American businesswoman Ruth Handler was vacationing in Switzerland until she came across Bild Lilli: a prostitute doll with long legs and heavy makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bild Lilli Doll\n\n\n\n\nThe first barbie doll came out in 1959."

Fry thought that Silver’s adhesive would be the ticket for a better bookmark.\nFry went to work the next day, ordered a sample of the adhesive and began coating it on paper, carefully coating only the edge of the paper so that the part protruding from his hymnal wouldn’t be sticky. Fry also realized that the bookmark could also be a note.\nIn 1978, 3Mers descended on Boise, Idaho, with samples for what would later be called the “Boise Blitz”. Boise was selected because it wasn’t too big a city.\nSamples were handed out, and 3M discovered that more than 90% of the people who tried them would buy them.\nAt the request of 3M marketers, Shirley Tholander (secretary to Lew Lehr, chairman of the 3M board) sent a letter to her executive secretary peers at Fortune 100 companies and enclosed a product sample.\nIncongruities\nAn Incongruity is an incompability - something that appears very different to the point of change.\nIn 1912, Charles Franklin Kettering invented the electric starter.\nBefore the electric starter, this boost was provided by a crank at the front of the car. Women and men of smaller stature had trouble working the crank without help. In addition, the crank was dangerous to operate, and some drivers were injured while cranking the car – this became a source of innovation.\nThe impetus for the electric starter came from a realisation of the incongruity between the demographics of car buyers versus the demographic composition of the world at large.\nWithout an easy way to start the car, car manufacturers were only selling to half2 the population!\nProcess Needs\nSBS Transit’s Iris NextBus and PostBox are good examples.\nIndustry Market and Structures\nIndustry structures can change, creating tremendous opportunities for innovation.\nIn the past, photographic film needed to be “processed” in a dark room.\nIn the digital world, processing can be self-serviced.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Outside a Company\nThese include:\n\nDemographic Changes\nThe graying of many societies is a demographic change that is looming.\nOne impact of this will be the increasing need for robots to do routine housework (and so on).\nChanges in Public Perception\nCirque du Soleil (i.e., CdS) capitalised on the changes in public perception on the use of animals in circuses (in addition, the cost of the animals and their training, medical care, housing, insurance, and transportation was very high).\nTraditional circus shows have a series of unrelated acts, but each Cirque du Soleil creation has a theme and story line, somewhat resembling a theater performance.\nNew Knowledge and Scientific Discoveries\nThere is a protracted time span between the emergence of new knowledge and its distillation into usable technology.\nThen there is another long period before this new technology appears in the marketplace in products, processes or services.\nTo become effective, innovation of this sort demands not one kind of knowledge but"

    "text": "2.5 Innovation Case Study #1: Shipping Containers\n\n\n\n\n\nA Shipping Container\n\n\n\n\nThe shipping container was invented by Malcolm Purcell McLean. MacLean was also responsible for founding pan-Atlantic services.\n\n2.5.1 Prior to the Shipping Container’s Fruition\nArmies of ill-paid and ill-treated workers called longshoremen would help unload and load supplies onto merchant ships. The whole (un)loading process would take a day - shipping costs were hence expensive (i.e., a four-thousand mile voyage for a shipment might consume about 50% of its costs for just two ten-mile movements).\n\n“In the first forty months of World War II, the U-boats sank 2,177 merchant ships totalling 11,045,284 tons, while the number of merchant ships lost to all other causes was negligible in comparison.”\n– Syrett, 1993, page 1.\n\nMany German “U-boats” (i.e., submarines) also sank many merchant ships during the Battle of the Atlantic.\nIn response to this, the US navy built more than 2400 “liberty ships” between 1941 and 1945. These ships were small enough to avoid being sunk so that little cargo would be lost if the ship was sunk.\nAfter the war, the US navy sold about 450 “liberty ships” to their merchant lines. However, these “liberty ships” were cramped and had odd dimensions - longshoremen needed to figure out how to fit cargo in these conditions. These “liberty ships” wasted time and money from the shipowners’ perspectives.\n\n2.5.1.1 More About Longshoremen\n\n\n\n\n\nLongshoremen Loading Bananas onto a Merchant Ship\n\n\n\n\nLongshoremen were individuals who saw themselve as tough, independent men who were doing a tough job. They had reputations as brawlers and drinkers.\nThe work that they did was brutal and physically dangerous, so much so that there were many injuries, and in some cases, fatalities.\nLongshoremen would also work in all sorts of weather conditions and would also compete among themselves for work. This entire process meant kickbacks, flattery, and begging. Because of this, their income was irregular and longshoremen would be loyal to their co-workers, not the company that they were working for.\nStrikes were also frequent due to poor pay and poor working conditions. In Britain alone, these strikes led to 1 million man-days lost between 1948 to 1951 and another 1.3 million in 1954. These strikes also led to two major problems:\n\nPilfering: longshoremen would end up stealing the cargo that they were supposed to load.\nResistance to anything that might eliminate jobs.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 McLean’s Background and Starting His Own Trucking Company\nMacLean was born in Maxton, North Carolina. His mother first taught him how to do business by giving him eggs to sell on commission.\nMcLean graduated from high school in 1931 and started working at a grocery store to stock shelves. He eventually became the manager of a gas station in a nearby town.\nMcLean learned that drivers were being paid $5 an hour just to transport gas to the station.\n\n2.5.2.1 McLean Trucking Company\nIn March 1934, McLean started the McLean Trucking Company. In 1935, he started off with two trucks and a truck trailer. He also employed nine truck drivers who owned their own rigs.\nIn 1940, he owned about 30 trucks and grossed about $230,000.\nIn 1945, he owned 162 trucks and in 1946, made a revenue of about $2.2 million.\nIn 1953, McLean noticed that the highways were becoming increasingly congested. He was also concerned that domestic ship lines were allowed to buy war-surplus cargo ships for a low price from the government.\nIn September 1955, McLean sold off his trucking company for about $14 million!\n\n\n\n2.5.3 McLean’s First Container Ship\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Image of the Ideal-X\n\n\n\n\nOn 26 April, 1956, 58 aluminium truck bodies were loaded aboard an ageing tanker Ideal-X that was moored in Newark, New Jersey. Ideal-X then sailed into Houston.\nOn 1 April, 1964, the Port of Singapore Authority (i.e., PSA) was formed to take over the functions, the assets, and the liabilities of the Singapore harbor board.\n\n2.5.3.1 What is a Shipping Container?\nA shipping container is an aluminum or a steel box that held up by rivets and welds - it has a wooden floor and two enormous doors at both ends.\nThe container cheapened transportation costs; it was also a part of a highly efficient and seamless system for shipping cargo across the world.\nThe container could also be loaded onto the Ideal-X in seven minutes (i.e., using a crane). The railroad and trucking business attempted to compete with McLean’s shipping containers. Between April and December, 44 voyages were created; consequently, the tanker’s capacity increased from 58 to 60 containers (before it increased to 62 containers).\n\n\n\n2.5.4 New York’s Decline\nMcLean’s containers made New York ports obsolete. During the 1920s, the trucking industry had already made New York’s ports obsolete.\nIn 1952, traffic leading to piers was so bad that pier-bound vehicles were banned from the Twelfth Avenue.\n\n\n2.5.5 Social Impact of Shipping Containers\nWhen the industry fled New York, the number of manufacturing jobs fell.\nThe Brooklyn Navy Yard closed in 1966, and Brooklyn residents abandoned the borough in droves. Brooklyn’s population fell by 14% between 1971 and 1980."

He was disturbed by what he saw. He thought: “we can put people on the moon and travel to the depths of the ocean, but we cannot get a wheelchair over a curb?”\nThe more he thought about the limitations faced by people in wheelchairs - no eye-level conversations, no trips to the beach or anywhere else without sidewalks, no reaching the top shelf at the grocery, no possibility of defeating the absolute barrier of stairs - the more he became offended as an engineer\n\n2.6.1 Kamen’s Invention\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iBOT Project Started by Kamen\n\n\n\n\nFred-iBOT was a wheelchair that could roll through gravel and sand, go up curbs, and even climb stairs. It would change the lives of many.\nThe project was funded by Johnson & Johnson, but did not take off likely due to cost issues.\n\n\n2.6.2 About Dean Kamen\nHe was born in Rockville Center, Long Island, New York, in 1951. He attended college at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.\nHe also owned a business, Independent Prototype, and did a project for Cordis, a medical company, through which he met the founder, William Murphy. He made about $60,000 a year\nBart, a medical student at Harvard, suggested that he work on a drug-infusion pump.\nFrom there, Kamen started a new company - AutoSyringe - where he designed the first portable insulin pump (which freed diabetics from their condition’s limitations).\n\n2.6.2.1 Starting a Family Business\nKamen’s brother, Mitch and Mitch’s friends became assemblers for the pump.\nHis mother tested circuit boards and kept the books.\nHis father drew the illustrations for the manual.\nHe enlisted the help of Worcester Polytechnic’s students and professors to help him improve the design of his inventions.\nKamen also moved to New Hampshire to evade New York’s high taxes.\nEventually, Kamen would sell the pump to Baxter Healthcare for about $30 million in 1982 (when Kamen was 31 years old).\nKamen would then go onto buy an airplane, a helicopter, and an island in Long Island Sound. He then founded his own R&D company DEKA (i.e., short for DEan KAmen).\nKamen’s first spinoff company Teletrol installed climate control systems for large industrial and commercial buildings\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Kamen’s Attitude Regarding Failure\n\n“In study after study, of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice-skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals,” writes the neurologist Daniel Levitin, “this number comes up again and again.\nTen thousand hours is equivalent to roughly three hours a day, or 20 hours a week, of practice over 10 years …. No one has yet found a case in which true world-class expertise was accomplished in less time. It seems that it takes the brain this long to assimilate all that it needs to know to achieve true mastery.”\n– Dean Kamen\n\nIn 1987, Baxter Healthcare approached Kamen to improve its kidney dialysis machine - it was noisy, expensive, heavy (180 lb) and bulky!\nKamen urged his engineers not to limit themselves to what they thought was feasible, and he did not hold failures against his engineers if they learned something along the way.\nHis philosophy was that no experiments was useless."

This was a problem as not only was it difficult to oversee such a vast amount of workers, but there would also be inconsistencies with the quality of labor.\nA&G then offered a price of $75000 to anybody who could invent an automatic cigarette rolling machine.\n\n2.7.1 James Albert Bonsack\nOn September 4, 1880, Bonsack - a teenager tinkerer - got a patent for his invention. His machine could turn out about 200 to 212 cigarettes per minute (roughly 40 to 50 workers’ output).\n\n2.7.1.1 Bonsack’s Machine’s Performance\nA&G ultimately rejected the machine for the following reasons:\n\nThey feared that cigarettes were traditionally hand-crafted.\nThey feared that the machine would be too efficient, leaving them with mountains of unsold cigarettes.\nOverall managerial timidity associated with the handling of the dismissals of unneeded workers.\n\nWashington Duke and his son, James Buchanan Duke, decided to install Bonsack’s machine in their factories. In 1889, Duke & Sons sold a billion cigarettes, and in 1890, formed the American Tobacco Company,\nThe machines brought about a tremendous reduction in the cost of manufacturing cigarettes.\nBy 1884, the Bonsack Machine was producing from 100,000 to 120,000 cigarettes per day, the equivalent of the production of forty to fifty hand workers.\nDuke, like other producers, initially overcame any popular prejudice against the machines in a very simple way: he used them in the greatest secrecy and the public remained unaware of their widespread application for years.\nThe Duke company began to produce most of its cigarettes by machine in 1885, encountering little of the consumer resistance its rivals had anticipated. Duke’s application of the Bonsack Machines revolutionized the business of making cigarettes; the profits of the Duke company rose during subsequent years.\nThis was also what happened to Leica."

Furious mobs also destroyed 40 customs post in the 18-mile wall surrounding Paris.\nBecause of this, France was bankrupt - the king didn’t know what to do and debts rose in England’s favor.\n\n3.2.1 8 August, 1788\nKing Louis XVI summoned the Estate General - something that hadn’t been done in 175 years (i.e., not since 1614).. The Estate General represents the three general orders of French society: clergy, nobility, and commoners.\nThere only about 500000 clergy and nobility in the Estate General and about 27 million commoners.\nNonetheless, Louis XVI ordered the Estate Geneal to form a cahiers de doléances, a notebook of grievances. One of the items was a reform of weights and measures.\n\n\n3.2.2 Formation of the National Assembly\nOn June 17, 1789, the deputies of the third estate (i.e., the nation) were locked out of the meeting hall at Versailles. They thought that that was Louis XVI’s way of forcing them to disband.\nInstead, the deputies had a meeting at a nearby tennis court - they swore to never disband until France had a written constitution.\n\n\n3.2.3 14 July, 1789\nLouis XVI let his finance minister Jacques Necker go. Necker was sympathetic to the third estate and was hailed as a reformer by the people.\nOn the same day, a large crowd bursted into the Invalides (i.e., old soldiers’ home and weapons depot) and carried 30,000 muskets and fire cannons. They also raided the bastille for gunpowder - by the end, the Invalides was theirs (with about 170 casualties).\n\n\n3.2.4 5 and 6 October, 1789\nA crowd of women (i.e., fishwives, stallkeepers, harlots, and seamstresses) marched towards the Versailles with weapons (e.g., cudgels, scythes, etc.) and demanded bread.\nOn the next morning, they found an open side gate and burst into the palace. With the heads of two guards impaled on a spike, they escorted the royal family to Paris and left them in the Tuileres Palace.\n\n\n3.2.5 21 June , 1791\nLouis XVI and Marie Antoinette slipped out of the Tuileres in servants’ disguise for a 200-mile dash to Austrian territory (that was overseen by Marie’s brother). However, a postmaster identified Louis and the couple was arrested and bought back to Paris. Both people were found guilty of treason.\nOn 21 September, 1792, the monarchy was abolished.\nLouis XVI was beheaded on 21 January, 1793 - his body was dumped in an anonymous grave.\nMarie Antoinette was beheaded on 16 October, 1793; her body was taken to a graveyard behind the Church of Medeline. However, the gravediggers were on a lunch break.\nThis opportunity gave Marie Groscholtz (later known as Madame Tussaud) enough time to make a was figure of her face.\n\n\n3.2.6 France’s Measurement Situation\n\n“Contemporaries estimated that under the cover of some eight hundred names, ancient regime France contained a staggering 250,000 different units of weights and measures.”\n– Alder, 2002, p. 3\n\nMany quantities were named as such because of their origins from human needs and interests.\nThe Greeks and Romans used fingers as a base measurement - a “foot”’s length is about the same as a human foot. The cubit foot was about as long as an arm’s bend at the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Because of this, the following measurements were fashioned:\n\n1 foot = 16 fingers\n1 cubit = 24 fingers\n\nAnthropometric measures also reflected the amount of labor that a person could do in one sitting. Coal was measured in charge and was equivalent to about \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) of a miner’s daily output. Arable land was measured in “homme” or “journee” to estimate the amount of land that a peasant might be able to plough in a day."

    "section": "3.3 Implications of the Metric System",
    "text": "3.3 Implications of the Metric System\nThere were many different kinds of implications (to different disciplines) when the metric system was introduced.\n\n3.3.1 Religious Implications\n\n“You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment regarding measures in length, weight, or quantity. You shall have honest balances, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an honest hin: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.”\n– Leviticus, 19:35-36\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Scientific Implications\nScientists argued that such a system should also proclaim universal measures (just as how the French revolution would also proclaim universal rights for all).\nScientists also derived the fundamental unit from the measure of the word itself.\n\n3.3.2.1 Fundamental Unit\nThe “unit of length” was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance along the meridian through Paris from the North Pole to the Equator.\nThe “meter” would be eternal as it was taken from the Earth itself (which was believed to be eternal). It was also equally belong to all people of the world as the Earth also belonged to each individual equally.\nAn alternative idea was that a fundamental unit of length could also be derived from the length of a pendulum beating one second. This was an idea that dated back to the 17th century when Galileo demonstrated that the period of a pendulum’s beat was determined by its length.\nHowever, the length of a one-second pendulum was also sensitive to the latitude at which it was measured, because gravity varied slightly with latitude. The equator may have been a suitable choice, but it was also quite remote from scientific nations; hence, the second most natural location would be 45\\(^\\circ\\) of north latitude - at the outskirts of Bordeaux in south-west France. However, the idea did not meet with international approval.\n\n3.3.2.1.1 Refinements to the System\nAuguste-Savinien Leblond - a French mathematician - coined the word “meter” (which came from the Greek word “metron”) for the fundamental unit of length.\nGreek prefixes were used for multiple measures of the meter and Latin prefixes for submultiples. This idea was proposed by Claude Antoine Prieur.\nFor a brief period of time, these prefixes scared people, so they were replaced with ordinary names (e.g., “decimeter” would used to be called a palme).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Meridian Expedition\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meridian on the Globe\n\n\n\n\nThe meridian is an imaginary north-south line on the Earth’s surface that connects both geographic poles. It is used to indicate longitude.\nIn June 1792, two astronomers - Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre and Pierre-François-André Méchain - went in opposite directions from Paris to measure a piece of the meridian arc that ran from Dunkirk to Barcelona through Paris.\nThey did this to establish a common standard of measure that people of all sorts could use it.\n\n3.3.3.1 Geodesy\nGeodesy is the science of measuring and understanding Earth’s properties - its shape, its gravity, its orientation in space - as well as how these properties change over time.\nVia GPS, many geodesists can measure the movement of a site 24 hours per day, seven days a week.\nGeodesy on a smaller scale is called surveying.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Standard for Mass\nAntoine Lavoisier and the crystallographer René-Just Haüy worked on the grave - the kilogram as it was previously called - as a cubic decimeter of rainwater weighed in a vacuum at the melting point of ice (i.e., 0\\(^\\circ\\)C).\nIn 1799, the chemist Lefèvre-Gineau would define the “gram” as a cubic centimeter of rainwater in a vacuum at the temperature of maximum density.\n\n\n3.3.5 First International Scientific Conference\nTwo months before Méchain and Delambre finished their measurements, foreign representatives arrived in Paris to attend the Congress on Definitive Metric Standards. This happened on 28 November 1798.\nThe instruments used for the preliminary work was inspected and tested in field observations. The representatives were asked to propagate the new system in their own countries.\n\n3.3.5.1 Adopting the Meter\nWhen the meter was introduced in France, it caused confusion. The system disrupted norms and opened local markets to outside competitions. Even physicians were afraid that they would have to re-learn all their dosages.\nNapoleon Bonaparte refused to learn the system - he insisted that the weights he got be restated in poids de marc (i.e., old-style pounds) as he could not “think” in the new units.\nEventually, a legislation passed in 1873 that would mandate the metric system mandatory throughout France and its colones from 1840 onwards.\n\n\n\n3.3.6 World Metrology Day\nThe meter convention was signed on 20 May, 1875 by representatives from the following nations:\n\nArgentina\nAustria\nBelgium\nBrazil\nDenmark\nFrance\nGermany\nItaly\nPeru\nPortugal\nRussia\nSpain\nSweden and Norway\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUSA\nVenezuela\n\nThis day also mandated the establishment of a permanent International Bureau of Weights and Measures (i.e., BIPM: Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) to be located in Sèvres, France.\nThis annivesary is now known as World Metrology Day."

    "text": "6.1 What is Biology?\nThe word Biology is derived from the Greek words “bios” (meaning “life”) and “logos” (meaning “study” or “knowledge”). Hence, Biology is the study of living organisms.\nIt also involves many other techniques such as Chemistry, Physics, or Mathematics.\nBiology also overlaps with Medicine to a great extent.\n\n6.1.1 Characteristics of Living Organisms\nAll living organisms will share the following characteristics:\n\nMovement\nAll living organisms exhibit some form of movement.\nReproduction\nAll living organisms come from pre-existing generations and can give birth to the following generation.\nReproduction can take many forms (i.e., asexually or sexually). DNA - among many other molecules - are involved in reproduction. DNA contains “instructions” for cellular structures and ultimately, for the whole organism.\nSensing\nAll living organisms will have some sort of response towards stimuli from the outside world.\nThese responses can be slow or fast.\nRespiration\nEverything that an organism does is governed by chemical processes (that consume energy). The energy to do work often comes in sugars, amino acids, and other biochemical processes - during which produces ATP.\nExcretion\nBiochemical reactions often result in the production of toxic waste products - these products are disposed via a method called excretion.\nPlants often store their waste.\nNutrition\nOrganisms obtain energy from food or from other sources - these sources provide energy that is needed for purposes such as cell growth, cell maintenance, and cell repair.\nAutotrophs take in simple, inorganic substances to turn into complex organic substances - these organisms are sometimes called producers. Plants - along with algae and phytoplankton - are the most familiar kind of autotrophs. Most autotrophs use photosynthesis to produce their own food.\nHeterotrophs take in ready-made substances - these organisms are known as consumers. Dogs, birds, fish, and humans are examples of heterotrophs; they occupy the second and third levels in a food chain.\nDetrivores (e.g., worms, fungi, and insects) obtain nutrition via consuming detritus: dead organic matter.\nThe food chain is a diagram that contains three trophic levels: autotrophs (first level), herbivores (second level), and carnivores and omnivores (third level).\nGrowth\nOrganisms grow by taking outside substances and incorporating it into its internal structure in a process called assimilation.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Divisions of Biology\nTraditionally, there were two: Zoology (the study of animals) and Botany (the study of plants). Over time, the following divisions appeared:\n\nMicrobiology\nThis is the study of microorganisms - this division can be divided into two more sub-divisions: bacteriology and virology.\nAnatomy\nThis is the study of plants’ and animals’ structures.\nBiochemistry\nThis is the study of chemical processes that underlie plant and animal life.\nCell Biology\nThis is the study of cell function and structure.\nEcology\nThis deals with the relationships of organisms and their environments.\nEvolution\nThis deals with how organisms evolve over time.\nGenetics\nThis is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity among living organisms.\nEntomology\nThis studies insects.\nOrnithology\nThis studies birds.\nHerpetology\nThis studies reptiles.\nMycology\nThis studies fungi.\nIchtyology\nThis studies fish.\nMalacology\nThis studies molluscs.\nPaleontology\nThis studies fossils and what they tell us about the ecologies of the past, about evolution, and about our place (as humans) in the world."

Chloroplasts are photosynthetic organelles - their job is to absorb light for photosynthesis.\n\n6.2.1 Chlorophyll\nChlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs and reflects specific wavelengths of light - these are also “light harvesting complexes”.\nThe most common kinds of chlorophyll are Chlorophyll A and Chlorophyll B. What separates them is their absorption spectrum.\n\n6.2.1.1 Discovery of Chlorophyll\nChlorophyll was found in 1817 by Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre Joseph Pelletier.\n70 years after the discovery of Chlorophyll C, Harold Strain and Winston Manning found Chlorophyll D in 1943.\nChlorophyll F - the latest chlorophyll discovery - was found by scientists at the University of Sydney by professor Min Chen’s group.\n\n\n6.2.1.2 Tree Loss Rates\n15.3 billion trees are cut down each year - the tree-to-person density ratio is about 422:1 for now.\nThe global amount of trees has fallen by 46% since the start of human civilization."

    "text": "6.4 Spontaneous Generation\n\n“Insects come into being spontaneously”\n– William Harvey (Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium, 1651)\n\nSpontaneous Generation is the idea that living organisms can originate from non-living organisms.\nBack in the days, it was believed that frogs, eels, mice, and other such organisms could arise spontaneously.\n\n6.4.1 Francesco Redi’s Experiments\nIn 1668, Redi carried out some experiments to show that maggots come from fly eggs, not rotting meat.\nAt that time, it was believed that maggots in rotting meat was evidence of spontaneous generation.\nRedi placed jars of meats in open air - one of them was covered in a fine muslin cloth. Redi saw that while flies of that particular jar would never get to the meat, they would still lay eggs on the cloth, hence disproving spontaneous generation as their origin.\nHowever, Redi still thought that some insects like gall flies arose by spontaneous generation.\n\n\n6.4.2 Pasteur’s Work\nHe carried 20 sterilized, sealed flasks high up in the Swiss Alps and opened them there.\nAnother set of flasks were also brought to the dusty streets of Paris. Only one flask in the Swiss Alps produced convincing proof of Pasteur’s position.\nPasteur’s work is recognized today as crucial in large scale effective control of disease.\nIf organisms spontaneously generated in decaying organic matter or other places, it would be very difficult to stop their natural formation unless one of the necessary ingredients, which was only hypothesized and never confirmed, was removed.\n\n6.4.2.1 Pasteur’s Swan Neck Experiment\n\n\n\n\n\nImage of Pasteur’s Swan Neck Flask\n\n\n\n\nPasteur’s experiment went as such:\n\nNutrient broth was poured into two flasks: an open necked flask and a swan necked flask.\nBoth broths were boiled to kill existing microbes\nThe broths were then left open and allowed to cool\n\nIn the end, microbes in the air reached the opened flask, but were caught in the layer of moisture in the swan-necked flask’s neck. The former flask turned cloudy while the latter remained clear.\nPasteur’s swan-necked design allowed air to pass into the flask, but the curved neck trapped any airborne microbes that might contaminate the broth.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Practical Implications\nIf only life begets life, then it is only a matter of preventing life from reaching the organism which one wants to prevent from becoming contaminated.\nThis is the purpose of sealing food in air tight containers or for destroying the organisms which spread disease by methods that are strong enough to destroy most microorganisms, but not their host (e.g., cooking).\nThis technique is the ordinary and primary method used today to control germs, and thus disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nBastian’s The Beginning of Life\n\n\n\n\nThe spontaneous generation controversy continued for several years after the work of Pasteur with scientists who advocated grasping at every possible straw to save it. A London physician, Henry Charlton Bastian (1837–1915) published a two-volume work entitled The Beginning of Life where he cited difficulties with Pasteur’s experiments."

    "section": "6.5 Taxonomy",
    "text": "6.5 Taxonomy\nThis is science of naming, describing and classifying organisms and includes all plants, animals and microorganisms of the world.\nUsing morphological, behavioural, genetic and biochemical observations, taxonomists identify, describe and arrange species into classifications, including those that are new to science.\nIn the past 250 years of research, taxonomists have named about 1.78 million species of animals, plants and micro-organisms, yet the total number of species is unknown and probably between 5 and 30 million.\n\n6.5.1 Species Problem\n\n“No other species displays such diversity as the dog.”\n– Karen Lange, Wolf to Woof\n\nAll dogs belong to the species Canis lupus familiaris, yet there are still many species.\nThe establishment of kennel clubs in the 1800s accelerated the process of artificial selection by encouraging new breeds. Most breeds established since 1900 were created for the sake of appearance.\n\n\n6.5.2 Why Study Taxonomy?\nTaxonomy helps us provide unique names for species and help us ensure that two different people are talking about the same organism. The Latin “scientific” name is given as a unique universal identifier.\n\n6.5.2.1 Modern Taxnomic Process\nTaxonomists begin by sorting specimens into sets that they think represent species.\nThey then go through the specimens to see if a specimen already has a name or not1.\nThese comparisons may also involve external characteristics, DNA analysis, or internal structure analysis too.\nIf no match is found, then a description has to be written, including ways that the species can be distinguished from other species. A new name (and one that is properly formatted) must also be formed.\nThis entire process can be length - it can take years.\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Carolus Linnaeus\n\n“Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.”\n– Genesis 2:19-20\n\nCarolus Linnaeus was born at Stenbrohult, in the province of Småland in southern Sweden on 23 May 1707.\nIn 1727, he studied medicine at the University of Lund, and a year later, he transferred to the University of Uppsala, where he spent time collecting and studying plants.\nAt the time, training in botany was part of the medical curriculum, for every doctor had to prepare and prescribe drugs derived from medicinal plants.\n\n6.5.3.1 Expedition to Lapland\nIn 1732, Linnaeus made an expedition to Lapland, the northernmost region of Sweden, with the objective of finding new plants, animals, and possibly valuable minerals.\nIn 1735, he completed his medical degree at the University of Harderwijk, and published the first edition of his classification of living things, the Systema Naturae.\nReturning to Sweden in 1738, he practiced medicine (specializing in the treatment of syphilis) and lectured in Stockholm before being awarded a professorship at Uppsala in 1741.\nAt Uppsala, he restored the University’s botanical garden (arranging the plants according to his system of classification), made three more expeditions to various parts of Sweden, and inspired a generation of students.\nHe was instrumental in arranging to have his students sent out on trade and exploration voyages to all parts of the world: nineteen of Linnaeus’s students went out on these voyages of discovery.\nHis most famous student, Daniel Solander, was the naturalist on Captain James Cook’s first round-the-world voyage, and brought back the first plant collections from Australia and the South Pacific to Europe.\nAnders Sparrman, another of Linnaeus’s students, was a botanist on James Cook’s second voyage.\nAnother student, Pehr Kalm, traveled in the northeastern American colonies for three years studying American plants.\nYet another, Carl Peter Thunberg, was the first Western naturalist to visit Japan in over a century. He not only studied the flora of Japan but taught Western medicine to Japanese practitioners.\nStill others of his students traveled to South America, southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Many died on their travels.\n\n\n6.5.3.2 Swedish Economy\nLinnaeus was also deeply involved with ways to make the Swedish economy more self-sufficient and less dependent on foreign trade, either by acclimatizing valuable plants to grow in Sweden or by finding native substitutes.\nUnfortunately, Linnaeus’s attempts to grow cacao, coffee, tea, bananas, rice, and mulberries proved unsuccessful in Sweden’s cold climate.\n\n\n\n6.5.4 Comparisons Between Kingdoms\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons Between Features in the Animal and Plant Kingdom\n\n\n\n\n\n“A few years ago Miss [Agnes] Joaquim, a lady residing in Singapore succeeded in crossing Vanda hookeriana and Vanda teres, two plants cultivated in almost every garden in Singapore.”\n– Henry Nicholas Ridley (1855 - 1956)\n\nSingapore’s national flower (i.e., the Papilionanthe) was bred by breeding two common household orchids together.\n\n\n6.5.5 Ernst H. Haeckel\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Kingdoms in the Taxonomy\n\n\n\n\nThe two-kingdom classification was adopted for a very long period in history of biological sciences.\nHowever, invention of microscope during the 16th century made it possible to explore the living world, which was not earlier possible to explore through the naked eye.\nThis exploration revealed an altogether new world of microorganisms sharing features of both plants and animals.\nFor example, Euglena are single-celled flagellated microorganisms that feature both plant and animal characteristics.\nOn the other hand, fungi have plant-like features such as immobility, irregular shape and indefinite growth but also posses heterotrophic mode of nutrition, a characteristic feature of animals.\nTherefore such microorganisms could not have appropriate placement in two-kingdom classification.\n\n\n\n\n\nBright Field Microscopy on a Protist\n\n\n\n\nIn order to classify these microorganisms, Ernst H. Haeckel, in 1866, proposed a three-kingdom classification in which he added a new kingdom – Protista.\nIn this new kingdom he included all simple microscopic living organisms such as bacteria, microalgae, protozoa, fungi and sponges.\n\n\n6.5.6 Robert Whittaker\nRobert Whittaker worked on the area of classification, and developed three-kingdom, four-kingdom, and five-kingdom classification systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhittaker’s Five-Kingdom Classification System\n\n\n\n\nHis five-kingdom classification system, which he published in 1969, is featured in many biology textbooks.\nThe five kingdoms defined by him were named Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia.\n\n6.5.6.1 Carl Richard Woese’s Domains\nIn 1990, Carl Richard Woese (1990) suggested further rectification in system of classification.\nRelying on the information gathered with the help of various techniques of molecular biology about different prokaryotes he proposed a revision.\n\n\n\n\n\nWoese’s Domains\n\n\n\n\nIn this classification, a new level – the domain – was introduced as the top category.\nThis taxonomic system is known as a three-domain classification that includes domains – Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya."

Democritus is also mentioned as being the teacher of Hippocrates who later treated him as a patient.\nHe came from a rich family. Later in his life, the people of Abdera tried Democritus in public and he was charged for spending the fatherly fortune.\nWhen he read them his works Great décor and On vulvar explaining that he spent the money on that, he was cleared.\nDemocritus is considered an erudite and a scientist with multiple interests, one of the most famous Greeks of his time, whom Sextus Empiricus compared with the voice of God Zeus. He is referred to as polyhistor (he who has a great and varied learning) and gelastinos (he who laughs at everything).\n\n6.6.1 Democritus’ Stance on Anatomy\nDemocritus’ views regarding the issue of human nature and anatomy are depicted in a letter he sent to Hippocrates of Kos.\nThe accuracy of his knowledge regarding the anatomy of the human body is explained by the plethora of dissections he had carried out, which results from his own writings.\nHowever, historians’ opinions on whether Democritus actually practiced cadaver dissection are contradictory. French historian Bouillet (1883) wrote:\n\n“Democritus dedicated long hours to dissection; his successors accused him of living in graves. True it was not, because he was never able to dissect human bodies”.\n– Bouillet\n\nGalen has left what has been called an abominable testimony, that Democritus used human parts and blood. Galen’s testimony therefore is in favour of the possibility that Democritus had actually practiced human dissections.\n\n\n6.6.2 Aristotle\nAristotle was born in Stagira, on the peninsula of Chalcidice in 384 BC.\nLater, he became the tutor of Alexander the Great, who was then 12. In about 336 BC, Alexander departed on his Asiatic campaign, and Aristotle, who had served as an informal adviser since Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne, returned to Athens and opened his own school of philosophy, the Lyceum.\nAlexander wrote books on zoology, astronomy, botany, poetry, drama, metaphysics, physics, ethics and other topics.\nWhile Plato distrusted the sphere of the senses, Aristotle did not. Like Plato, Aristotle conceded the role of the intellect in the acquisition of learning, but he regarded the senses as no less significant.\nThis to him, the physical cosmos was as vital as the spiritual, and was equally deserving of study.\nNot surprisingly, Aristotle wrote a number of volumes devoted specifically to physics and biology (e.g., De Animalia, or On the History of Animals).\n\n6.6.2.1 Aristotle’s Views on Taxonomy\n\n“Animals may be characterised according to their way of living, their actions, their habits, and their bodily parts.”\n– Aristotle\n\nAristotle was interested in categorising all life-forms. Many consider him the inaugurator of systematic taxonomy in the style of Linnaeus.\nUsing behaviour and native habitat as a guide, he divided all beasts into land animals, animals that always live in the water (e.g., fish), and animals that live periodically in the water, but reproducing on land (e.g., otter, alligators, and beavers).\nAristotle’s classification system had two principal divisions, the Genos and the Eidos. Genos signified broad categories of animals, such as a mammal, while Eidos referred to specific kinds of animals within the Genos, such as cats, horses, tigers, and so forth.\nAlexander the Great sent him most of the material he needed for his studies.\nAlthough his theories and specific classifications have altered considerably, several of the fundamental tenets still influence contemporary biology.\n\n\n6.6.2.2 Aristotle’s Views on Reproduction\nAristotle distinguished between sexual and asexual reproduction. The latter, he believed occurred via “spontaneous generation”.\nIn line with later thinking, Aristotle believed spontaneous generation occurred primarily in more primitive animals, such as fleas and mosquitoes, which could arise, spontaneously from decaying substances.\nAristotle was the first to realise that that mother and the father were of equal weight in the creation of a new organism.\n\n\n6.6.2.3 Aristotle and the “Vital Force”\nAristotle concluded that the heart controlled the flow of blood and was also the source of “animal heat” – the conviction that an undetectable, non-physical “force” keeps animals alive.\nWhat distinguishes animate from inanimate matter, such as a rock, is precisely that the latter does not have the “vital force” while the former does.\nIn 1928, Friedrich Wöhler demolished the concept of vitalism when he synthesized urea (CH4N2O) in his laboratory.\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Galen of Pergamum\nGalen was born in 131 in the city of Pergamum in Asia Minor. Although born a Greek, he later moved to Rome, fell in love with Roman culture, and even altered his name to the more Roman Claudius Galenus.\nAfter his philosophical training, Galen began to study medicine, first in Corinth, and later in Alexandria.\nHe returned to Pergamum in 158, becoming a court physician at the city’s school for gladiators. He then headed for Rome, where he began teaching science. There, he gained a reputation in medicine and became the personal physician of Marcus Aurelius.\nGalen also treated quite ordinary people – not only the wives, children, and slaves of the rich, but the peasants he encountered in the countryside, friends of friends he met in the street, and the miscellaneous patients who walked or were carried to the clinic he operated in his home. He claims have provided his services for free.\nBecause of this, he became a public figure, known and recognized by many, accosted in the streets, challenged to debate, accompanied everywhere by a crowd of friends, supporters, students, domestic servants, and professional assistants.\n\n6.6.3.1 Galen’s Speculations\nGalen used the pulse to diagnose illness, although he had no understanding of the circulatory system. He put together an encyclopedia of medical knowledge, relying heavily on Aristotle.\nFor the circulation of blood, he described the aorta and the primacy veins of dogs, pigs, sheep and other animals.\nHis discussions of the digestive system are an interesting blend of fact and fiction. He claimed that the stomach had a mysterious force called “transformation power”, which allowed it to digest food.\nTo pursue his anatomical ideas, Galen examined creatures of every imaginable species. He was unafraid to perform vivisection (dissecting a living body), except on human beings.\nHis descriptions of the circulatory system dispelled the myth that the left chamber of the heart contained air. Although he had no grasp of the importance of oxygen in physiology (Joseph Priestley only discovered oxygen in 1774), he did in a way anticipate this view when he defended the tenet that there was some hitherto undiscovered element in the blood which was the basis of life. Oxygen is, of course, this element.\n\n\n6.6.3.2 Galen’s Misshaps\nGalen made mistakes in his anatomy. He maintained (mistakenly) that both veins and arteries carried blood away from the heart, and that the wall between the left and right ventricles were porous, allowing blood to pass between them. He also claimed that the liver was the “seat” of the venous system.\nCultural taboos prevented Galen from dissecting human bodies, forcing him to rely on animals – a deficiency he candidly acknowledged and one that led to numerous errors.\n\n\n\n6.6.4 Leonardo da Vinci\nLeonardo was born in the village of Vinci, near Florence, in 1452. Many historians surmise that he actually dissected as many as thirty corpses in his youth.\nHe recorded his commentary in the form of notes and drawings, of which 4,000 pages are still extant.\nLeonardo’s finely detailed drawings helped others make headway in understanding the muscular and skeletal systems, and the relationship between them.\n\n6.6.4.1 Leonardo’s Work in Anatomy\nAnatomists in Leonardo’s time often dissected unclaimed bodies, such as of drunks and vagrants, and those bodies were more likely to be male.\nStudying them would have been obnoxious work because they didn’t have any form of embalming, and within two or three days, the body decomposes.\nBecause of this, Leonardo’s illustrations of human anatomy are uncannily accurate with just one major exception: the female reproductive system.\nMany of his drawings of the female reproductive system get details wrong.\n\n\n\n6.6.5 Andreas Vesalius\nAndreas Vesalius (née Andries van Wesel) was born in 1514 in Brussels.\nHe studied at the University of Louvain (1529 - 1533), then at the University of Paris (1523 - 1536).\nWhile in France, he took lessons from Jacobus Sylvius, an ardent Galenist and famous physician in his own right, who later came to oppose bitterly his student’s anatomical discoveries that denied the preeminence of the ancients.\nFinally, he transferred to the University of Padua – the premier medical university of the era – to complete his doctorate in December 1537.\n\n6.6.5.1 Vesalius’ Dissections\nUniquely for the era, Vesalius insisted on the importance of actual dissection, by both teacher and pupil, when learning anatomy.\nHis position afforded him time to study the human body. Vesalius began his anatomical studies shortly after assuming his Chair at Padua.\nHe personally dissected cadavers and encouraged / forced his students to do the same. Bodies typically came from the gallows or fresh graves.\nThe local magistrate courteously timed Padua’s executions around Vesalius’ needs.\nIt was this hands-on engagement that enabled Vesalius to master the subject and make his portentous discoveries. While a professor, he published several texts and a dissection manual for his students that portended his magnum opus.\nVesalius’ investigations culminated with his 1543 publication of De Human Corporis Fabrica Septem Libri, or Seven Books on the Fabric of the Human Body. A second edition, significantly revised and dramatically improved, appeared in 1555.\n\n\n6.6.5.2 Vesalius’ Seven Books\nHis seven books covered the following (in order):\n\nThe human skeleton\nMusculature of the human body\nVasculature of the human body\nThe human body’s nerves\nThe human body’s gastrointestinal system\nThe human heart and lungs\nThe brain\n\nIt was 663 pages, with 83 plates containing 420 illustrations, of which the “muscle men” remain the best known.\nScholars have debated for centuries who actually created the figures, with the artists Titian (c. 1488/90-1576) and van Calcar (c. 1499-1546) as leading contenders.\nMost medieval and early modern anatomy texts lacked any illustrations and relied on written description to portray the human body.\nVesalius’ images, in addition to their artistic beauty, illuminated the subject of anatomy for students and facilitated its mastery.\nTheir seamless integration within the text set a new standard for the field. Moreover, he initiated a trend, furthered by subsequent anatomists such as Fallopio, Eustachi, and Albinus, who likewise filled their works with gorgeous and useful images, a practice continued by Netter and other modern anatomists.\n\n\n\n6.6.6 Plastination\n\n\n\n\n\nvon Hagens with Two Plastinated Bodies\n\n\n\n\nIn July 1977, Gunther von Hagens was working as a research scientist at the University of Heidelberg’s Institute of Pathology and Anatomy.\nLooking at specimens embedded in plastic – the most advanced preservation technique then available – he wondered why the plastic was poured around bodies rather than into them.\nHe came up with the idea of vacuum-impregnation, whereby bodily fluids are drained and soluble fat are extracted and replaced with resins, silicon rubbers and epoxies – a process taking a year.\n\n“In the beginning, I thought plastination would mainly contribute to improving medical teaching.\nBut the huge subsequent lay interest inspired me to create public exhibitions – not to shock people, but capture their imaginations.”\n– Gunter von Hagens\n\nHe named the process plastination. After a year of intense research, and hundreds of experiments, he filed the first patent for plastination, a technique now used in 400 medical schools and universities worldwide, in March 1978.\n\n6.6.6.1 Public Displays\nThe first Body Worlds exhibition, featuring whole body plastinates, was shown in Japan in 1995.\nThe displays feature healthy and diseased body parts as well as skinned, whole corpses in assorted poses – a rider atop a horse, a pregnant woman reclining.\nIn 2018, von Hagens is suffering from Parkinson’s disease, and has requested to be plastinated when he dies, and become a permanent part of the Body Worlds exhibition.\nThe Body Worlds exhibition was held in Singapore in 2003 and in 2009.\nThe “The Cycle of Life” exhibit was excluded from the Singapore exhibition because it included copulating cadavers.\nCritics have denounced von Hagens’ work as disrespectful to the dead, others are appalled that dead bodies are used to make money. There was also controversy about the origin of his specimens. He has stated that the bodies of executed Chinese prisoners has not been used."

    "section": "6.7 William Harvey and the Heart",
    "text": "6.7 William Harvey and the Heart\nWilliam Harvey was born in Folkestone, Kent on 1 April 1578. His father was a merchant. Harvey was educated at King’s College, Canterbury and then at Cambridge University.\nHe then studied medicine at the University of Padua in Italy, completing his studies in 1602.\nHarvey married Elizabeth Browne, daughter of Elizabeth I’s physician, in 1604. In 1607, he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and, in 1609, was appointed physician to St Bartholomew’s Hospital.\nThrough his teachings and observations, Harvey began to develop a new theory to explain how blood flowed through the body.\nHe conducted thorough research, including numerous dissections of human beings and as many as 40 animal species.\nHarvey pored over the results before compiling them and publishing his groundbreaking Exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis in animalibus (On the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals) in 1628.\nOnly about 70 pages long, it became a gigantic milestone.\n\n6.7.1 Heart Transplantation\nThe most controversial and famous operations of the twentieth century – human heart transplantation – was first performed by the South African surgeon Christiaan Neethling Barnard on 3 December 1967.\nPopular twentieth-century histories often single out this surgical endeavour as a great or defining moment in world history, as important as the moon-landing of 1969. On par with space travel, it has been frequently used to symbolise human ability and medical achievement.\nThe first heart transplants were as much media as medical events.\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, 2 December 1967, a car collided with a mother and daughter who were crossing a Cape Town road. The mother died instantly and her daughter, Denise Darvall, was left critically injured and unconscious. A motorist passed by the scene, unaware that the accident was irrevocably going to change her own family’s life.\nShe was on her way to visit her husband, dentist Louis Washkansky, who was in the nearby Groote Schuur Hospital suffering from end-stage cardiac disease. By 6 the next morning, Denise Darvell’s heart was beating inside Louis Washkansky’s chest. Christiaan Barnard, from the Groote Schuur Hospital, had led a team in conducting the first ever human-to-human heart transplant.\n\n“The young Republic of South Africa is rightly very proud of the magnificent feat achieved by a medical team at Groote Schuur Hospital in performing the first successful transplant of a human heart. The claim “successful” can be used even at this early stage because to date, it is a feat which makes medical history, no matter how short the further survival of the patient might be.”\n– South African Medical Journal\n\nLouis Washkansky died on 21 December 1967, eighteen days after receiving the heart of Denise Darvall.\n\n\n6.7.2 Gaspare Tagliocozzi\n\n\n\n\n\nA Patient After a Nose Job\n\n\n\n\nIn 1597, Gaspare Tagliacozzi, a professor of surgery at the University of Bologna, published De Curtorum Chirurgia per Insitionem, an illustrated guide that documented for the first time a technique for performing a rhinoplasty, or nose job.\n\n“We restore, repair, and make whole those parts which nature has given but fortune has taken away, not so much that they delight the eye, but that they buoy up the spirit and help the mind of the afflicted.”\n– Tagliacozzi\n\nTagliacozzi improved the reconstructive surgery methods that had been developed in Italy in the 1400s and 1500s to repair noses which had been amputated, usually in war.\n\n6.7.2.1 Riducling Tagliacozzi’s Grafts\nThe Catholic Church judged that he had been tampering with the will of God and excommunicated him. Grafts became an object of ridicule. In 1909, the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal noted that by the eighteenth-century rhinoplasty “sank into disuse and in course of time began to be considered impossible or fabulous.”\nIn the subsequent centuries, reconstructive techniques improved, but the principle remained the same. Tissue used to repair a wound had to be taken from the patient’s own body. Otherwise, the immune system would attack and destroy it!\n\n\n6.7.2.2 “Uniqueness” of Individuals\n\n“The singular character of the individual entirely dissuades us from attempting this work on another person. For such is the force and power of individuality, that if anyone should believe that he could accelerate and increase the beauty of union, nay more, even achieve even the least part of the operation, we consider him plainly superstitious and badly grounded in the physical sciences.”\n– Tagliacozzi\n\nThe Venetian adventurer Nicolò Manuzzi (1639– 1717) settled in India and left a travelogue manuscript, published much later, in which he records that he had seen many natives with restored noses.\nManuzzi had acquired some surgical skills and was asked to repair a nose but to use a slave donor for the skin.\nManuzzi replied that “it would be of no avail, for being another’s flesh it would not unite”.\n\n“Concerning homoplastic transplantation (allografts) of organs such as the kidney, I have never found positive results to persist … whereas in autoplastic transplantation (autographs) the results was always positive. The biological side of the question has to be investigated very much more and we must find out by what means to prevent the reaction of the organism against a new organ.”\n– Alexis Carrel to Theodor Kocher\n\nNo one, though many experiments have been reported, has yet succeeded in keeping an animal alive for any great length of time which carried the kidney or kidneys of another animal after its own kidneys were removed.\nThe outlook is by no means hopeless and the principles of immunity, which yield such brilliant results in many other fields, would seem to ne worthy of being tested in this case.\n\n\n\n6.7.3 Cyclosporin\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Formula of Cyclosporin\n\n\n\n\nIn 1969, Sandoz biologist Hans Peter Frey, collected a soil sample which contained the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum (Beauveria nivea), from Hardangervidda, a national park in Norway. Sandoz encouraged employees to collect such samples on business trips and holidays to search for new antibiotic drugs from fungal metabolites.\nThe immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine was discovered on 31 January 1972 by employees of Sandoz (now Novartis), in a screening test on immune suppression designed and implemented by Hartmann Stähelin.\nThe extraordinary commercial success of cyclosporin is due to its immunosuppression and absence of cytotoxicity.\nAmong 170 liver transplants between 1967 and 1980, Thomas Starzl’s team reported only a 30% 1-year survival rate. Roy Calne’s series of 130 liver transplants between 1968 and 1983 achieved similar results.\nIt was apparent that acute and chronic rejection of the donor liver by the host immune system remained a major clinical problem that was limiting the efficacy of liver transplantation.\nIn 1978, Calne and others obtained extremely encouraging experimental results using cyclosporin in animal organ grafts, which was followed shortly by introduction into human transplantation.\nThree years later, Starzl reported a doubling of the 1-year survival rate of liver transplant recipients to about 60% using cyclosporine and prednisone for immunosuppression after liver transplantation.\nBetween January 1, 1988 and April 30, 2012, 115,458 liver transplants were performed in the USA alone. The 1-year survival of a liver transplant patient has improved to 85%–88%, and the 5-year survival is ∼74%."

    "section": "6.9 Diabetes and Insulin",
    "text": "6.9 Diabetes and Insulin\nDiabetes mellitus is a chronic disease where the body does not make or does not use insulin properly, resulting in having too much sugar in the blood.\nSugar comes from the food we eat. The body needs sugar to make energy.\nThe amount of sugar in the blood of a normal person is closely controlled by a substance called insulin, which is made by the pancreas. People with diabetes either do not produce enough insulin or the insulin produced does not work well. As a result, sugar builds up in the blood.\nDiabetes is one of the most studied diseases in the history of medicine.\nDiabetes was first described in Ancient Egypt around 1552 BC (the Ebers Papyrus). Ever since then, physicians around the world tried to test and treat the “sugar sickness”, as it was called. However, with insulin still unknown, diabetics were doomed to waste away.\nDoctors in Egypt, India, and Greece all watched as the patients they desperately tried to save inevitably fell into comas and died. Indian physicians called it madhumeha (‘honey urine’) because it attracted ants.\n\n6.9.1 Where are the Pancreas?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation of Pancreas\n\n\n\n\nThe pancreas is a long, flattened gland located deep in the abdomen. The pancreas contains exocrine glands that produce enzymes important to digestion.\nThe islets of Langerhans create and release important hormones (insulin and glucagon) directly into the bloodstream.\n\n\n6.9.2 Types of Diabetes\n\nType I Diabetes\nPersons with Type 1 diabetes cannot control their blood sugar properly because their pancreas produces little or no insulin. They need insulin injections to control their blood sugars. It usually happens to young people.\nType II Diabetes\nAbout 80% of all persons with diabetes belong to this group. They can produce insulin, but their body does not use it effectively. It is often the result poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n\n\n6.9.3 Statistics in Singapore\nAbout 9% of the adult population in Singapore have diabetes. 90% of people with diabetes are over 40 years old.\nSome risks of diabetes mellitus include:\n\nFamily history\nOverweight\nMore than 40 years of age\n\nPregnancy\nExposure to a trigger mechanism (a virus or chemical substance)\n\nAmong the major ethnic groups in Malaysia, Indians (24.9% in 2011 and 19.9% in 2006) had the highest prevalence of T2D, followed by Malays (16.9% in 2011 and 11.9% in 2006) and Chinese (13.8% in 2011 and 11.4% in 2006).\nThese epidemiologic differences could be due to the genetic makeup, diet, and cultural variants among these major ethnic groups.\n\n\n6.9.4 Origin of the word “Diabetes”\nThe term “diabetes” was probably introduced by the Greek physician Demetrius of Apamea or by Aretaeus of Cappadocia (129-199 AD).\nLater, the word mellitus (honey sweet) was added by Thomas Willis (Britain) in 1675 after rediscovering the sweetness of urine and blood of patients (first noticed by the ancient Indians).\nIn 1776, the Liverpool physician Matthew Dobson firstly confirmed the presence of excess sugar in urine and blood as a cause of their sweetness.\nDiabetes is a wonderful affection, not very frequent among men, being a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine. The course is the common one, namely, the kidneys and bladder; for the patients never stop making water, but the flow is incessant, as if from the opening of aqueducts.\nThe nature of the disease, then, is chronic, and it takes a long period to form; but the patient is short-lived, if the constitution of the disease be completely established; for the melting is rapid, the death speedy. Moreover, life is disgusting and painful; thirst, unquenchable; excessive drinking, which, however, is disproportionate to the large quantity of urine, for more urine is passed; and one cannot stop them either from drinking or making water.\n\n\n6.9.5 Pre-Insulin Era\nCharacterised by the efforts of controlling diabetes by means of bizarre pharmacological treatment such as the use of opium or dietary interventions, based on the conviction that diabetic patients should eat extra-portion for compensating their endocrinological and metabolic impairment.\nHowever, some physicians began to notice that it was fasting and not an excess of calories to improve the clinical symptoms of diabetes. They introduced dietary restrictions such as “Bouchardat’s treatment” or “starvation diets”.\n\n6.9.5.1 Paul Langerhans\nIn 1869, Paul Langerhans made the first careful and detailed description of the microscopic structure of the pancreas. He described nine different types of cells including small, irregularly shaped, polygonal cells without granules, which formed numerous cell heaps measuring 0.1 to 0.24 mm in diameter, throughout the gland. Langerhans refrained from making a hypothesis as to the nature and importance of these cells. In 1893, the French histologist GE Languesse named these spots “ilots de Langerhans”.\nIn 1875, Langerhans moved to the island of Madeira because of pulmonary tuberculosis, but he did not stop his scientific work.\nHe continued his zoological studies of the fauna of the Canary Islands and Madeira, and wrote a handbook for travelers to the island.\nLangerhans was also interested in his own disease and published two papers on tuberculosis.\nIn Madeira he practiced medicine in the capital, Funchal, where in 1888 he died of a kidney infection.\n\n\n\n6.9.6 Diabetes Cases and Treatments\nThe below cases were common:\n\nCase 1\nA man in his late fifties began to have severe pain in one of his toes, causing constant suffering and loss of sleep. Then, it began to turn black. His family doctor confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes which he himself had feared, since a brother and several members of his family had been diabetic.\nA surgeon, consulted in the hope that the gangrenous toe could be amputated, was unwilling to operate. He stated that, with diabetes, healing would fail to occur. The man was bedridden for months as the gangrene extended into his foot. Finally death came to end his suffering.\nCase 2\nA young girl with diabetes in an early stage, was treated with the Allen “starvation diet” then in vogue. Introduced by Dr. Frederick Madison Allen, and promoted by Dr. Elliott Proctor Joslin, dietary restriction of extreme degree was then the chief hope for juvenile diabetics. The results for this girl at first appeared successful, but suddenly diabetic coma developed, and she was gone.\n\nIn 1889, two German researchers, Oskar Minkowski and Joseph von Mering, discovered that removing a dog’s pancreas (total pancreatectomy) would provoke severe symptoms of diabetes.\nThey begun the speculation that a mysterious substance produced by the pancreas is responsible for metabolic control.\nIn 1907 a Belgian investigator Jean de Meyer proposed it be named “insulin”.\nThe discovery of insulin at the University of Toronto by in 1921-22 was one of the most dramatic events in the history of the treatment of disease.\nOn December 2, 1921, Leonard Thompson, 14, arrived at the emergency of Toronto General Hospital.\nHe weighed just 30 kg (as he had been on a “starvation diet”), and his life hung by a thread. His diabetes had been diagnosed two years earlier.\nThompson’s father let the hospital try Banting and Best’s new pancreatic extract for the first time.\nOn January 11, 1922, Leonard Thompson became the first patient with diabetes to receive insulin injections.\nAfter an impure form of insulin failed to improve Leonard’s condition initially, a purer version restored his blood glucose levels back to normal and his symptoms began to disappear.\nTwo weeks later, on 23 January 1922, Leonard underwent a second series of insulin injections and the results were stunning. His life was, literally, saved by insulin and he became the poster boy of the now commonplace medical miracle.\nWhen Leonard was aged 27, 13 years after his first insulin injections, he died of pneumonia, which was thought to be a complication of his diabetes.\n\n\n6.9.7 Controversy over Nobel Prize\nIn 1923, Frederick Banting and John MacLeod were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. The prize aroused a lively and debated controversy.\nIn 1955, the British biochemist Frederick Sanger managed to fully sequence the bovine insulin and discovered its exact composition in terms of amino-acids. For this discovery, Sanger won the Nobel for Chemistry in 1958.\nFor the discovery of the physical structure of insulin, the English biochemist Dorothy Mary Crowfoot-Hodgkin (1910–1994), a pioneer in the protein X-ray crystallography, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964."

    "text": "6.10 Insect Metamorphoses\nJan Swammerdam was born on 12 February 1637 in Amsterdam. He qualified as a medical candidate in October 1663.\nAfter obtaining his doctorate, Swammerdam concentrated mainly on the study of insects. The purpose of Swammerdam’s work on insects and other lower animals was to refute the Aristotelian idea that these were imperfect animals, by systematically contradicting the Aristotelian arguments that they lacked internal anatomy, originated spontaneous generation, and developed through an abrupt metamorphosis.\nWilliam Harvey proposed that the insect egg contains so scarce nutrients that the embryo is forced to hatch before completing development.\nThen, during the larval life, the animal would accumulate enough resources to reach the pupal stage, which Harvey considered as the perfect egg.\nSwammerdam showed that the pupa is not a sort of egg but a transitional stage between the larvae and the adult. He classified insect metamorphoses into four main types.\n\n6.10.1 Types of Metamorphoses\nThere are four kinds:\n\nType I\nInsects that grow without transformation (lice were his example)\nType II\nIn a second type, he included the species that develop the wings progressively and that transform into adults without any intermediate, quiescent stage (as crickets and cockroaches).\nType III\nRepresented by species whose wings develop under the larval cuticle and that undergo a quiescent pupal stage before transforming into adults (as in butterflies and beetles)\nType IV\nSpecies that pass the pupal stage under the skin of the last larval stage (represented by flies)\n\n\n\n6.10.2 Textbooks on Insects\nAlthough refined and completed with many examples, Swammerdam’s categories are essentially the same as the one used today.\nAmetabolans, which do not experience morphological transformations along the biological cycle.\nHemimetabolans, which hatch as nymphs with a morphology similar to that of the adult and grow progressively until the adult stage, which gain full flying wings and functional genitalia.\nHolometabolans, which hatch as a larva morphologically very different from the adult, then progressively grow through successive moults until the last larval instar, after which they moult into the pupal stage, often quiescent and similar to the adult, and then to the adult stage, with flying wings and fully formed and functional genitalia."

    "text": "6.11 Vitamins\nGelatin (also called gelatine) is an animal protein prepared by the thermal denaturation of collagen, isolated from animal skin and bones, with very dilute acid. It can also be extracted from fish skins.\nChemically, gelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of single or multi-stranded polypeptides. More about this in a later lecture (on biochemistry)!\nFor now, let’s go back to Paris in the early 1800s. Philanthropists were seeking ways to feed the poor. Chemists discovered that gelatin could be extracted from leftover bones.\nSo they came up with an idea – people of means could consume the meat, while the poor would receive a gelatin broth. However, the poor revolted against the unappetizing broth.\nThe authorities appointed a committee, the Gelatin Commission, to evaluate gelatin. After ten years of research, the Commission concluded that gelatin was not a complete food.\nBy the late nineteenth century, the prevailing dogma held that there were four essential elements of nutrition: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals.\n\n6.11.1 Cause of Disease: Germ Theory\nGerm theory, that diseases are caused by infectious organisms or toxins produced by these organisms became the reigning principle in science.\nLouis Pasteur (1822 – 1895) and Robert Koch (1843 – 1910) were influential proponents of the germ theory of disease.\nInvestigations identified the organisms responsible for anthrax, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, leprosy, and diphtheria.\nOther diseases such as scurvy, beriberi, rickets, and pellagra – considered by some to be infections – continued to baffle scientists.\n\n“Scurvy and rickets are conditions so severe that they force themselves upon our attention; but many other nutritive errors affect the health of individuals to a degree most important to themselves, and some of them depend upon unsuspected dietetic factors …”\n– Frederick Gowland Hopkins\n\nIn a speech in 1906, Frederick Gowland Hopkins stated that “… no animal can live upon a mixture of pure protein fat, and carbohydrate, and even when the necessary inorganic material [i.e., minerals] is carefully supplied the animal still cannot flourish.”\n\n“Mice can live quite well under these conditions when receiving suitable foods (e. g., milk), however, as the above experiments demonstrate that they are unable to live on proteins, fats, carbohydrates, salts, and water, it follows that other substances indispensable for nutrition must be present in milk …”.\n– Nicolai Lunin\n\nCarl Socin, demonstrated that there was an unknown substance in egg yolk that was essential to life, and he raised the question of whether this substance was fat-like in nature.\n\n\n6.11.2 During the Seige of Paris\n\n“Since no conscientious chemist can assert that the analysis of milk has made known all the products necessary for life … we must renounce, for the present, the pretension to make milk. … It is therefore always prudent to abstain from pronouncing upon the identity of these indefinite substances employed in the sustenance of life, in which the smallest and most insignificant traces of matter may prove to be not only efficacious, but even indispensable … The siege of Paris will have proved that we… must still leave to nurses the mission of producing milk.”\n– Dumas\n\nMany infants and toddlers died when the city was cut off from the milk supply of the countryside. Some opportunists tried to manufacture an artificial substitute for cows’ milk, but this artificial milk failed to sustain the infants. Many children died.\n\n\n6.11.3 Vitamins\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists who Discovered Vitamins\n\n\n\n\nIn 1912, Hopkins showed that young rats did not grow well when fed a basal ration of protein, starch, cane sugar, lard, and minerals. After a small amount of milk was added to the basal ration, they had normal growth. The unknown factors in milk that supported life were found in “astonishingly small amounts” and were termed “accessory factors” by Hopkins.\nCasimir Funk (1884 – 1967) proposed the term “vitamine” instead of “accessory food factors” in 1912 for the deficient substances in the food as related to beriberi, scurvy, and pellagra.\nIn 1913, University of Wisconsin biochemist Elmer McCollum (1879–1967) was able to distinguish two different species of vitamins, which he called “fat-soluble factor A” and “water-soluble factor B.”\nThe announcements by Hopkins, Funk, McCollum and others sparked enormous worldwide interest in this new area of research. Over time, more vitamins were discovered."

    "text": "7.1 Chemical Notations\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Chemical Notations by John Dalton\n\n\n\n\nIn 1782, Guyton de Morveau stated that, in the interest of science, it was necessary to have “a constant method of denomination, which helps the intelligence and relieves the memory”.\nIdeally, an element or compound should have a unique name because the proliferation of names for the same substance can lead to confusion.\nIn 1803, John Dalton, starts using symbols to represent atoms of different elements.\nDalton’s symbols were not the ones we use today, but circles containing distinct symbols (a dot for hydrogen, a cross for sulfur), or circles containing letters (“C” for copper,“L” for lead).\nHe used them singly to represent elements and in combination to show compounds.\nLater, Swedish chemist, Jöns Jakob Berzelius simplified the system.\nBerzelius organized 47 elements with letters alone, and he based those letters not primarily on the English names, but on the Latin ones.\n\n7.1.1 Jöns Jacob Berzelius\nBerzelius wrote a textbook for his students, and in the process, he became convinced that chemistry was in a state of confusion.\nIn particular, he felt the need for a more helpful method of naming and classifying chemical substances – perhaps resembling binomial nomenclature, the system developed by his fellow countryman, Linnaeus (1707-78).\nHe published his system in a series of articles published in 1813 and 1814. His system of chemical symbols survived and it remains the basis of chemical nomenclature today.\nHaving organised the elements, he then tried to create a notation for compounds which revealed their chemical nature.\nAt first, he indicated the numbers of atoms with superscripts, so that sulphur dioxide was written SO2.\nEventually, the subscript version (SO2) became the standard form. At first, many chemists were not impressed by the Berzelian symbols. By the mid-century, though, they were generally accepted.\n\n\n7.1.2 IUPAC\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry was formed in 1919 by chemists from industry and from academia.\nIts primary aim in chemical nomenclature is to provide a methodology for assigning descriptors (names and formulae) to chemical substances so that they can be identified without ambiguity, facilitating communication.\nThe origin of the names of some elements (e.g., antimony and iron) is obscure, and lost in antiquity.\n\n7.1.2.1 Origin of Element Names\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Origins of Elements’ Names\n\n\n\n\nElement names are based on:\n\nAn element’s properties\nA mineral that the element is isolated from\nThe place or area of discovery (e.g., Gallium)\nA mythological character or concept\nAn astronomical object\n\nThe origin of words is known as etymology. The study of the origin of the names of chemical elements is known as elementymology."

    "section": "7.2 Periodic Table of Elements",
    "text": "7.2 Periodic Table of Elements\nIn the middle 1800s, elements were being discovered almost every decade.\nThis profusion of new elements, with an ever-widening range of properties soon began to provoke questions:\n\nPrecisely how many elements were there?\nHad most of them already been discovered?\nOr would there perhaps turn out to be innumerable elements?\n\nThese questions led to speculations.\nSomehow, amongst all the elements, there must be some kind of fundamental order.\nJohn Dalton had already discovered that the atoms of each element had different weights.\nBerzelius had noticed that elements had different electrical affinities.\nThere were also groups of elements with similar properties:\n\nMetals that resisted corrosion\nCombustible alkali metals\nColorless, odorless gases\n\nThe Periodic Table is of central importance to chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Periodic Table of Elements\n\n\n\n\nIt provides a logical framework for recognising patterns in the properties of elements and their compounds. It also allows us to explain trends and similarities in properties in terms of the electronic structures of the elements.\nWithout the Periodic Table, chemistry would be a hotchpotch of unrelated information about different substances.\n\n7.2.1 Johan Döbereiner\nDöbereiner was a professor of chemistry at the University of Jena. He was the son of a coachman, and was largely self-educated. He became a pharmacist, and attended regular local public lectures on science.\nHe eventually secured a position at the University of Jena, where his lectures were regularly attended by Goethe.\nIn 1829, Döbereiner noticed that the recently discovered bromine had properties which seemed to lie midway between those of chlorine and iodine. Not only that, it’s atomic weight lay exactly halfway between the two.\nDöbereiner began studying the list of known elements, recorded with their properties and atomic weights, and eventually discovers another two groups of elements with the same pattern:\n\nStrontium (between calcium and barium)\nSelenium (between sulphur and tellurium)\n\nHe looked for further examples, but could find no more. Döbereiner Law of Triads only applied to nine of the fifty-four known elements.\nIt was dismissed by his colleagues as a coincidence.\n\n\n7.2.2 Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois\nIn 1862, de Chancourtois published a paper describing a “telluric screw”, which demonstrated that there did indeed appear to be some kind of pattern amongst the elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nChancourtois’ Elemental Screw\n\n\n\n\nThe “telluric screw” consisted of a cylinder on which was drawn a descending spiral line. He was intrigued to find that the properties of these elements tended to repeat when they were read of in vertical columns down the cylinder.\nIt seemed that after every 16 units of atomic weight, the properties of the matching elements tended to repeat when the elements were read off in vertical columns.\nDe Chancourtois’s paper was published, but he used geological terms, and even introduced numerology.\nThe publishers omitted to include the illustration of the cylinder, rendering the article virtually incomprehensible to all but the most persistent readers.\n\n\n7.2.3 John Newlands\nIn 1864, John Newlands came up with his own pattern of the elements.\nIn his research, Newlands came up with findings that bore a resemblance to those of de Chancourtois. Newlands discovered that if he listed the elements in ascending order of their atomic weights, in vertical lines of seven, the properties of the elements along the corresponding horizontal lines were remarkably similar.\nThe eighth element starting from a given one is a kind of repetition of the first, like the eighth note in an octave of music. He named this his ‘law of octaves’.\nSodium – potassium; magnesium – calcium, chlorine – bromine – iodine\nUnfortunately, the properties of some elements especially those of higher atonic weight, simply did not tally. Even so, this is the first solid evidence that there was indeed some comprehensive pattern to the elements.\n\n\n7.2.4 Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev\nThe Father of the Periodic Table is Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev. Mendeleev was born in Tobolsk (in Siberia). He was the 17th child in his family.\nHis father was the headmaster of the local school, but became blind in the year of Dmitry’s birth, leaving the mother to provide for the large family.\nMendeleyev went to school in Tobolsk, and did badly. He learnt Ancient Greek and Latin, and Mendeleyev developed a distaste of high culture which was to last a lifetime.\nHis brother-in-law (Bessagrin) instilled in him a deep interest in science.\n\n7.2.4.1 The Journey to Moscow\nIn 1849, when Dmitry was fifteen, his mother set off with her two remaining dependent children, Dmitri and Liza – for Moscow. This meant a laborious 1,300-mile journey.\nMaria Mendeleyava was now 57 years old, tired and aged will beyond her years after bringing up her huge family single-handedly, while at the same time running a factory and organizing the welfare of its workers.\nBut she was determined that Dmitri should receive the education his promise deserved.\nIn Moscow, they encountered problems enrolling into the university.\nEntry from the provinces was according to a quota system, but the province Mendeleyev was from had not been given a quota yet, and so he was denied entry. In addition, they found that Siberian qualifications were not recognised in Moscow.\nAs a last resort, they set off for the capital, St Petersburg. Fortunately, Maria found that the head of the Central Pedagogical Institute was an old friend of her husband. Mendeleyev was given a place to study mathematics and natural science, and a government scholarship.\n\n\n7.2.4.2 Being a Top Student\nIn 1855, Mendeleyev qualified as a teacher, taking the gold medal for the best student of his year. His first appointment was to a teaching post at Simferopol in the Crimea. He arrived to find the Crimean War in full swing, and the school at Simferopol closed for months.\nHe went back to St Petersburg and was appointed privat Dozent (untenured, unpaid lecturer) in the University of St Petersburg. In 1859, he managed to secure a government grant to study abroad for two years. On the advice of Borodin, he headed first to Paris, and then to Heidelberg.\nIn 1861, Mendeleyev returned to St Petersburg, taking up a teaching position at the Technical Institute. To his astonishment, he found that Russia simply hadn’t heard of the fundamental advances in modern chemistry which were taking place all over Europe.\nHe started to deliver lectures about these developments, and began attracting attention. He also write a Russian textbook on modern organic chemistry. In 1864, he became a professor, and bought a small estate two hundred miles from St Petersburg.\n\n\n7.2.4.3 External Work\nBy 1867, he was being sent as far afield as Baku in the Caucasus to advice on the establishment of an oil industry, and Paris to organise the Russian pavilion at the Exposition Internationale.\nAt age 32, Mendeleyev was appointed professor of general chemistry at the University of St Petersburg. His lectures were on inorganic chemistry, but his students were hampered by the lack of an adequate textbook.\nBy early 1869, he had completed the first volume of his projected two0-volume The Principles of Chemistry. This was to be his masterpiece.\nThe end of the first volume covered the halogen group. The halogens combine readily with potassium.\nSo the obvious logical step was to start volume two with the alkali metals group, which contained sodium and potassium. By the morning of 14 February 1869, the two chapters were complete. The problem now was what group of elements to deal with next. The structure of the book depended on this. By 17 February, he still hadn’t come up with anything.\n\n“I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper.”\n\nMendeleev\n\n\nIn his dream, Mendeleyev had realised that when the elements were listed in order of their atomic weights, their properties repeated in a series of periodic intervals. For this reason, he named his discovery the Periodic Table of the Elements.\nIn his table, where no element fitted into the pattern, he simply left a gap. H predicted that these gaps would one day be filled by elements which had not been discovered.\n\n7.2.4.3.1 Julius Meyer\nThe German scientist, Julius Meyer, published a paper claiming that he had discovered the Period Table. Mendeleyev was given credit for the discovery of the periodic table because he published first (1 March 1869), whereas Meyer only published the following year.\nIn addition, Meyer’s conclusions were more tentative, and he couldn’t fully account for the anomalies in his table.\nIn 1875, Paul Lecoq de Boisbaudran announced the discovery of gallium. In 1886, Clemens Alexander Winkler discovered germanium.\n\n\n\n7.2.4.4 Mendelevium\n\n\n\n\n\nElement Symbol for Mendelevium\n\n\n\n\nIn 1955, element 101 was discovered by Albert Ghiorso, Bernard Harvey, Gregory Choppin, Stanley Thompson, and Glenn Seaborg at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.\nIt was named Mendelevium, in recognition of Mendeleyev’s achievements.\n\n\n\n7.2.5 CAS Numbers\nThe Chemical Abstracts Service (i.e., CAS), a division of the American Chemical Society, maintains a registry of chemical substances that assigns each chemical a registry number (“CAS Number”) and a unique systematic name.\nEvery chemical is assigned a CAS Number.\nOn 8 September 2009, it recorded the 50 millionth substance in the registry.\nThe CAS Registry is the world’s most comprehensive and high-quality compendium of publicly disclosed chemical information. The CAS Registry can be accessed free from Common Chemistry.\nCAS numbers have three uses:\n\nSearching for physical, chemical, or thermodynamical data on a chemical compound\nOrdering a chemical compound\nWhen looking for safety information (MSDS) on a chemical compound.\n\nEach element is tested using 64-17-5 (i.e., ethanol)."

    "section": "7.3 Washing Soda",
    "text": "7.3 Washing Soda\nWashing soda is the common name for sodium carbonate (Na_2_CO_3_). It is used in the manufacture of soap, detergent, textiles, glass and paper.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Formula for Washing Soda\n\n\n\n\nNicolas Leblanc invented an industrial process to make pure washing soda.\nBefore Leblanc, soap was a handmade luxury for the rich and a medicinal salve for the sick. After him, soap became an everyday part of modern life.\nIt revolutionised personal cleanliness and prevented scabies, an itchy skin disease. When the British government removed its soap tax in 1853, the price of soap dropped and the incidence of scabies plummeted. Soap also reduced the incidence of typhus.\n\n7.3.1 King Louis XVI’s Reward and Later Years\nNicolas Leblanc was a poor orphan (his father died when he was nine) who studied chemistry with Jean Darcet, one of France’s first chemistry\nLouis XVI offered 12,000 livres for the best way to turn common salt into washing soda for the manufacture of soap. For Leblanc, the contest represented a chance at attaining wealth, security, and professional acclaim.\nChemists had long known that sea salt could be transformed into sodium carbonate, and French scientists understood that the two compounds are related. No one could make the process work on a large, industrial scale, though.\nAt 42, Leblanc took up the challenge.\nHe knew the first step – mixing salt with sulphuric acid to make sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid (readily available):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  2NaCl + H_2SO_4 \\longrightarrow Na_2SO_4 + 2HCl\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe challenge was the second step. Leblanc wrestled with the problem for five years between 1784 and 1789, and then stumbled upon the solution. As Leblanc heated his sodium sulphate with charcoal, he added a key new ingredient – limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  Na_2SO_4 + CaCO_3 + 2C \\longrightarrow Na_2CO_3 + CaS + 2CO_2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nUnfortunately for Leblanc, in July 1789, Parisian mobs stormed the Bastille and triggered the French Revolution. The timing could not have been worse. The absolute monarchy was gone, and with it all changes of his winning Louis XVI’s prize money.\nJean Darcet confirmed Leblanc’s discovery, and recommended it to their patron, the Duke or Orleans. He wrote:\n\n“I the undersigned, professor of chemistry at the Royal College of France, …, certify that … with the same process, it will be easy to establish a factory.”\n– Jean Darcet\n\nThe Duke of Orleans was visiting London, so in February 1790, Leblanc crossed the English Channel on his first trip outside France. Orleans agreed to invest $8 million in a start-up factory to exploit Leblanc’s secret process.\nWith a year of getting the duke’s support, Leblanc opened a small factory at Saint-Denis, and started to transform his laboratory project into a large-scale factor.\nLeblanc also applied for a patent. On 19 September 1791, Leblanc became the 14th inventor granted a patent under France’s new laws.\n\n“The last letter received pierced my soul, for I learnt that they have suspended the payment of the pensions and pledges of the people who were attached to me. I cannot tell you how I was affected by that. I put this sorrow among the biggest sorrows that I have suffered.”\n– Leblanc in wriitng to his mistress\n\nFor the next two years, Leblanc struggled to get his factory going amid wartime shortages of sulphuric acid and capital. The Duke of Orleans was arrested, and two days before his execution, he wrote the above to his mistress\nAmong those affected was Nicolas Leblanc. The Duke of Orleans was executed in November 1793, and Leblanc’s factory was seized. The Committee of Public Safety called for patent holders of soda processes to publish their methods:\n\n“A true republican does not hesitate to relinquish the ownership of even the fruits of his mind when he hears the voice of his country entreating for aid.”\n– Committee of Public Safety\n\nLeblanc submitted his discovery to the committee, which published a brochure describing his process in minute detail as the French government wanted as many factories as possible to manufacture washing soda.\nWithin months of the execution of the Duke of Orleans, Leblanc had lost his salary, the factory, and his patent. The revolution had already cost him his chance of winning Louis XVI’s prize money. Meanwhile, Leblanc’s wife had fallen ill, and he had four children to support.\nThe government was sympathetic about the loss of his patent, and appointed him to a patchwork of administrative and study posts, most of them unpaid.\nOn 16 January 1806, Leblanc committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.\n\n\n7.3.2 Leblanc Pollution\nLeblanc’s process continued to be used, and produced much pollution, devastating entire communities. For each ton of washing soda made, three quarters of a ton of HCl spewed into the air, poisoning farmland. As HCl poured into the waterways, it combined with sulphur to make H2S gas, spreading a rotten egg smell for miles around:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  2NaCl + H_2SO_4 \\longrightarrow Na_2SO_4 + 2HCl\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn 1856, the French National Academy of sciences concluded that “scarcely anyone has done so much for industry and received so little reward as did Leblanc.”\nIn 1863, the British Parliament passed the Alkali Act, which forced the Leblanc factories to reclaim 95% if the HCl that they produced. Angus Smith, the Alkali Inspector assigned to enforce the law, demonstrated that industrial towns suffered from higher sulphate levels than did the countryside.\nHe also coined the term acid rain, and air pollution became a public issue. Bu the 1870s, Leblanc factories emitted less than 0.1% of the HCl they produced. The rest was reclaimed and sold. People started cleaning themselves with soap on a regular basis too. Cheap soap prevented scabies, a disease almost forgotten."

Christopher Columbus brought sugar cane to plant in the Caribbean islands on his second voyage in 1493.\nSpain, England and France grew sugar cane with slave labor on their island colonies, and their product was far cheaper than European sugar cane grown with free labor.\n\n7.4.1 Triple Effect Evaporator\n\n\n\n\n\nA Drawing of a Triple Effect Evaporator\n\n\n\n\nNorbert Rillieux was born on 17 March 1806 to a wealthy white man and his longtime mistress. Norbert’s father, Vincent Rillieux, was a cotton merchant and engineer. His mother, Constance Vivant, was a free African American from a rich real estate family in New Orleans.\nShe herself was the daughter of a white father and a black mother. Norbert Rillieux’s birth was registered as “Norbert Rillieux, quadroon libre, natural son of Vincent Rillieux and Constance Vivant.” The words quadroon libre, stipulated that Norbert was a free African American with more white ancestry than black.\nIn the 1820s, Vincent Rillieux sent Norbert to Paris for his education, but more specifically, to master its science and sugar technology. France was vitally interested in sugar, and they were studying the sugar-making process intensively. Scientists had known for roughly 75 years that many plants contain sucrose, and Napoleon had launched a crash programme to make France independent of imported cane sugar.\nAfter Napoleon’s defeat, French scientists continued their research, trying to make beet sugar grown by free farmers in France competitive with cane sugar grown by slaves in the New World.\n\n\n7.4.2 Rillieux’s Experiments\nEdmund Forstall, a planter and banker in New Orleans, asked Norbert to become the chief engineer of a sugar factory under construction there. In 1833, Norbert left Paris and returned to New Orleans. Norbert quit his job with Forstall almost as soon as it began. Forstall had a disagreement with Norbert’s father, and the younger Rillieux honoured his family ties.\nRillieux began to engineer his laboratory into a practical apparatus. He needed a sugar planter to let him build and test his equipment.\nFinally, Judah Benjamin and Theodore Packwood offered Rillieux the use of their sugarhouse. They agreed to pay Rillieux $13,500 if his sugar was as good and plentiful as the previous year’s crop.\nRilleux’s triple-effect evaporator was a tremendous success, and Rillieux travelled around Louisiana installing his machinery. About thirteen of Rillieux’s systems were installed before the Civil War.\nRacial problems caused Rillieux to permanently to France.\n\n\n7.4.3 Retirement\nGerman farmers adopted Rillieux’s equipment enthusiastically. By 1888, Rillieux systens were refining beet sugar in 30 German, 100 Austrian, and 20 Russian factories.\nRillieux-produced beet sugar added both sweets and meat to European diets. Sugar consumption more than doubled during the last 25 years of his life. Penned livestock could be fed molasses and beet residue.\nRillieux married, and studied Egyptology and hieroglyphics, never returning to Louisiana."

    "text": "7.5 Clean Drinking Water\nCholera outbreaks can occur sporadically in any part of the world where water supplies, sanitation, food safety and hygiene practices are inadequate.\nOvercrowded communities with poor sanitation and unsafe drinking-water supplies are most frequently affected.\nCholera is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.\nPeople become infected after eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated by the faeces of infected persons.\nRaw or undercooked seafood may be a source of infection in areas where cholera is prevalent and sanitation is poor.\nVegetables and fruit that have been washed with water contaminated by sewage may also transmit the infection if Vibrio cholerae is present.\nImproved hygiene and clean drinking water is the solution to cholera.\nQueen Victoria’s personal physician, John Snow, removed the handle from the polluted Broad Street pump in London to prevent the waterborne disease.\n\n7.5.1 Secret Affairs\nEdward Frankland’s mother, Margaret Frankland, worked as a maid for the Gorsts, a wealthy family of distinguished lawyers and judges.\nThe Gorsts’ 20-year-old son Edward was living at home, and the two young people had a secret affair.\nWhen Margaret Frankland became pregnant, the Gorsts were horrified as any hint of scandal would destroy the young man’s prospects.\nHis father functioned as the queen’s chief legal officer in Lancashire County, and his family was expected to be an unblemished example for all.\nAn illegitimate child disgraced both mother and father, and the latter was expected to support the child or face the consequences in court.\nEdward Gorst set aside an annuity of £1,200 for Margaret Frankland and her child – provided that his identity was never revealed.\nHe paid Margaret the interest from the annuity, about £60 per year. Eventually, the annuity was probably replaced b a one-time payment of £1,500.\n\n7.5.1.1 Becoming a Pharmacist\nMargaret Frankland was banished from the Gorsts’ household, and moved back to her family home outside Garstang to give birth and raise her son.\nOn 18 January 1825, Edward Frankland was born in Churchtown, Lancashire.\nThe child’s name combined his father’s first name and his mother’s maiden name. Thus the Gorsts were protected from publicity, but the child was not.\nTo anyone who knew him, Edward Frankland’s use of his mother’s unmarried name was assign of “bastardy,” a Victorian disgrace.\nFrankland wanted to become a doctor, but could not afford medical school. So in 1840, when Frankland was 14, she apprenticed him to a pharmacist.\nAs an apprentice, he worked more than 70 hours a week, wheeling heavy casks of treacle through town and hauling 100-pound sacks up a steep and narrow staircase. To grind a pound of cocoa, he worked a 20-pound pestle continuously for a day. To make ointment, he spent more than 24 days grinding six pounds of mercury into 14 pounds of lard.\n\n\n7.5.1.2 Friendship with John Tyndall\nFrankland’s analytical chemistry skills were enough to land him a teaching job. At one of the schools, he befriended a fellow teacher, John Tyndall, who later became a prominent British physicist.\nThe two men had a mutual pact to wake up at 4:00 a.m. each day and study together. Frankland taught Tyndall chemistry, and Tyndall taught Frankland biology and mathematics.\nA year later, Frankland and his friend, John Tyndall left to earn their doctorates from Bunsen in Germany.\nAfter his studies, he returned to England in 1849 to become a professional chemist. Frankland worked on organic compounds containing arsenic, and coined the term “organometallic” to describe this group of compounds.\nFrankland became aware that each element has a definite combining power.\nValency, as the principle is called today, is one of the fundamental concepts in chemistry. The valence of an atom equals the number of bonds that an atom has for combining with other elements. Hydrogen has a valence of one.\nFrankland sends his report on valency to the Royal Society on May 10, 1850. Unfortunately, the secretary laid the report aside and forgot about it for a year!\nIn the meantime, August Kekulé ignore Frankland’s work, and claimed the valence theory for himself.\nIn contrast, Frankland’s work in organometallic compounds attracted considerable attention, and when the University of Manchester opened, Frankland was appointed its chemistry professor.\n\n\n7.5.1.3 Transforming Chemistry Education\nAt age 40, he was appointed to a prestigious professorship to replace August Wilhelm Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry. In addition to his regular duties, Frankland was responsible for analysing London’s water supply.\nFrankland transformed chemistry education by integrating the laboratory into the curriculum. He compiled a list of 109 experiments that students needed to understand, and wrote a textbook that became a standard for chemistry instruction.\nFrankland developed the system for writing chemical formulae and for depicting the bonds between the atoms in molecules.\nAs he synthesised more and more isomers, compounds with the same formulae but different molecular structures, he found traditional formulae confusing – they showed the types and numbers of elements but provided no clue as to how the atoms were arranged inside the molecule.\nTo solve this problem, Frankland depicted the atoms in functional groups, and drew lines between them to indicate the bonds between the elements.\n\n\n7.5.1.4 Attaining Success\nCholera killed more than 20,000 people in England in the early 1830s.\nIn 1865, Frankland became London’s water consultant, and a member of the Rivers’ Pollution Commission in 1868. At the time, little was known about clean water (Robert Koch only identified the cholera bacillus in 1883).\nWhile some experts thought that decaying matter directly caused disease or indirectly nurtured disease-causing microbes, others regarded faeces-rich water as no more than unacceptably disgusting. Terrified of cholera, people demanded sanitary water.\n\n\n7.5.1.5 Discovering Helium\nIn 20 October 1868, Frankland co-discovered helium with English astronomer, Joseph Norman Lockyer.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelium’s Entry on the Periodic Table\n\n\n\n\nThey observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which Lockyer named the D3 Fraunhofer line.\nFrankland and Lockyer decided to name the element Helios, the Greek word for Sun.\nAlthough no one knew how cholera was spread, it was clear that there was a relationship between cholera and unsanitary water.\nFrankland: “My motto, unlike that in criminal cases, has always been to assume water to be guilty until it is proven innocent.”\nHe stressed that water’s appearance should not be used as an indicator of its safety."

It is 300 times sweeter than sugar.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Formula for Saccharin\n\n\n\n\nSaccharin has been used as a non-nutritive sweetening agent since 1907.\nSaccharin quickly rose to popularity as the first calorie-free sweetener, when it became known as the “poor man’s sugar” during World War II when real sugar was in short supply and thus more expensive.\nUnfortunately saccharin had a bitter aftertaste, so there was an increasing demand for a new improved sweet substance.\nIn 1937, 59 years after saccharin had been discovered, Michael Sveda, a graduate student at the University of Illinois, discovered cyclamate, another sweetener.\n\n7.6.1 Saccharin Story 1\nProfessor Ira Remsen of Johns Hopkins University was lecturing to his class using samples of newly-prepared chemicals before him. During the lecture, “he unconsciously poked his pencil into several samples”.\nLater, in his office, Professor Remsen happened to be troubled over a tough problem. While contemplating over it, he unconsciously touched the tip of the pencil to his lips and was amazed by the incredible sweetness.\nHe rushed back to his lecture hall and systematically tasted all the chemicals until he found the one prepared by Fahlberg.\n\n\n7.6.2 Saccharin Story 2\nConstantine Falhlberg discovered saccharin while working in Ira Remsen’s laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. He spilled a chemical on his hand when he was researching new and interesting uses of coal tar derivatives.\nLater on in the day when he was eating dinner, he noticed his bread rolls tasted sweeter than normal. However, when he mentioned this fact to his wife, she told him that they tasted the same as usual.\nAfter realising he hadn’t washed his hands, Falhberg traced the sweet taste to be coming from the chemicals.\n\n\n7.6.3 Saccharin and Cyclamate\nThe FDA approved cyclamate in 1951. Cyclamate was blended with saccharin and sold as “Sweet ‘n’ Low”, which quickly became popular in the United States. Cyclamate was also used to sweeten soft drinks.\nin 1970, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned cyclamate from all dietary foods in the United States, due to suspicion of inducing cancer in experimental animals.\nA study by Wagner found an increased incidence of bladder carcinomas in rats. Cyclamate is converted to a very toxic metabolite, cyclohexylamine.\nStudies in laboratory rats during the early 1970s linked saccharin with the development of bladder cancer, especially in male rats. It was banned in 1981.\nHuman epidemiology studies (studies of patterns, causes, and control of diseases in groups of people) have shown no consistent evidence that saccharin is associated with bladder cancer incidence.\nIn 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removes saccharin from its list of hazardous substances."

His fellow students called him “Dr Gift” – the German word for poison.\nDöbereiner arranged for Runge to perform a demonstration of atropine’s ability to make cats’ pupils dilate for Goethe. Goethe was suitably impressed, and at the end of their meeting he presented Runge with a packet of coffee beans, suggesting that their chemical components might be worth investigating. Runge studied the beans, and later that year, he discovered caffeine.\n\n7.7.1.1 Runge’s Other Inventions\nIn 1819, while still a student, Runge made another remarkable discovery for which he is seldom credited, isolating quinine from cinchona bark. The discovery of quinine, the first effective antimalarial compound, is usually attributed to Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, who reported their work a year later.\nHe also invented paper chromatography, a method for separating chemicals.\nRunge died on 25th March 1867, at the age of 73. He lived the last years of his life in poverty and obscurity."

He suspected that the unique flavour of one of its primary ingredients, the seaweed kombu (giant kelp), might hold the secret to dashi’s unique flavour-boosting ability.\nBack at his lab at the University of Tokyo, Ikeda ran dashi through a series of evaporations and tests to isolate its individual chemicals as solids.\nEventually, he came across a brownish crystalline substance that had a mild but intriguing flavour, and the same flavour-boosting powers of dashi. The residue was mostly glutamic acid.\nIkeda became the first scientist to associate glutamic acid with savouriness in food. He called this taste umami – based on the Japanese root “umai,” meaning “delicious,” or simply “good.”\n\n7.8.1 Founding Ajinomoto\nHe refined and patented a way to produce pure glutamic acid, stabilising it with a salt ion to create what we now know as monosodium glutamate.\nHe called the company he founded to produce MSG Ajinomoto (“the essence of taste”), thus forever linking umami, the taste, with glutamic acid, the chemical. It remains one of the largest producers of MSG in the world today.\nAjinomoto began selling MSG in 1909 and in the next few years expanded across east Asia. In 1947, pure MSG was introduced for sale in America as the “flavour awakener” Ac’cent.\n\n\n7.8.2 Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\nRobert Ho Man Kwok, a Chinese-American doctor in Maryland, wrote a letter in the 4 April 1968 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine under the heading “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome”:\n\n“For several years since I have been in this country, I have experienced a strange syndrome whenever I have eaten out in a Chinese restaurant.”\n– Ho Man Kwok\n\nThe most prominent symptoms included “numbness at the back of the neck, gradually radiating to both arms and the back, and general weakness and palpitation.”"

In 1862, Queen Victoria popularized the colour by wearing a mauveine-dyed gown.\nMauveine consists of as many as 12 molecules.\nWilliam Henry Perkin grew up on London’s East End. He dreamt of becoming an artist until he was showed some simple chemical experiments. From then, he began dreaming about an apprenticeship in an apothecary’s shop.\nIn 1853, William enrolled in the Royal College of Chemistry (later, it becomes a part of Imperial College), where he studied with August Wilhelm Hoffman, a German chemist who had come to London at the personal invitation of Queen Victoria’s German husband, Prince Albert.\n\n7.9.1 August Wilhelm Hoffman\nPrince Albert hoped Hofmann could teach Englishmen to use chemistry to solve important commercial problems concerning natural dyes, drugs and other essential commodities. Like many chemist of his day, Hofmann was analysing and testing compounds extracted from natural sources. In particular, he was investigating the chemicals in cold tar, an abundant waste by-product of coke production and coal gas lighting.\nHofmann speculated that he might be able to turn aniline in to quinine, and set William to investigate this. William had his own ideas on how this could be achieved, but his work for Hofmann left him little time to work on them.\nOver Easter vacation in 1856, William decided to work on his ideas at home. Perkin began with a cold tar derivative with almost the same formula as quinine, but without as much oxygen. He chose different compounds to mix with, and with aniline, a black precipitate was produced.\nTreating it with ethanol, he discovered that it made a ravishingly beautiful purple dye – a synthetic dye! Natural dyes were very expensive and coloured fabrics were still a luxury for most of the world’s population. Growers of natural dyes were also hard-pressed to keep up with the accelerating demands of the cotton textile industry.\nAfter experimenting with the solution on silk, Perkin realised that he had discovered a process for transforming the chemicals in coal tar into a colourfast purple dye. He mailed a sample to a Scottish dye time. After exposing the sample to sunlight, the owner replied:\n\n“If your discovery does not make the goods too expensive, it is decidedly one of the most valuable that has come out for a very long time. This colour is one which has been very much wanted in all classes of goods, and could not be obtained fast on silks, and only at great expense on cotton yarns.”\n– Owner of a dye shop\n\nPerkin and his brother prepared a few ounces of the dye – enough to apply for a patent, which they did no 26 August 1856. When he told Professor Hofmann that he was starting his own business, the professor was annoyed and discouraging.\nInstead of buckling under, Perkin dropped out of college and plunged ahead with his purple dye. He promised himself that later in life, he would return to scientific research.\n\n\n7.9.2 Imperial College’s Speech\n\n“The purple in the hoods you and other Imperial graduates wear were chosen because of Perkin. The colour purple symbolises the spirit of endeavour and discovery, and the risk-taking nature that characterises those with an Imperial education and training.\nLike William Perkin you, our postgraduate students, are risk takers. When you enrolled, you knew you were taking on challenging advanced courses of study and research. […] You have undertaken projects not knowing where they will lead.”\n– Alice Petry Gast"

    "text": "7.10 Cocaine\nArchaeological studies in South and Central America has established the antiquity of coca use. Analysis of mummified human remains from Northern Chile indicates the use of coca as early as 1000 B.C. These records establish that the use of coca has been ongoing for over 3,000 years among the native peoples of the Andes.\nUnder Incan rule, coca was used for numerous purposes, including mystical, religious, social, and medicinal uses. In 1532, a Spanish expedition conquered the Inca. The Spanish conquerors then attempted to eradicate the use of coca in the native cultures.\nThe Spanish failed, and decided to exploit coca growth instead.\nSubsequently, coca use became more widespread throughout the former Incan empire, and the custom of giving agricultural workers a ration of coca leaves along with their daily wage began. Coca use continues to be a daily staple in the life of many Andean workers.\nThe Aymara people are an indigenous population of the Andes and Altiplano regions of South America. “Khoka” is an Aymara word that means “the tree.”\nThis is the origin for our modern usage of “coca”.\nThe coca shrub is indigenous to South America, Mexico, Indonesia, and the West Indies, with numerous alkaloid components.\nAfter Paolo Mantegazza graduated as a medical doctor, he embarked upon a journey that ultimately brought him to Salta, Argentina. He practiced from 1855 to 1858 in Argentina and Paraguay where he came into contact with coca-chewing Indians.\nBased on his experience with the locals in the Peruvian Andes, he became convinced of the widespread benefits of coca including reduction of fatigue, improvements to one’s mood, and even the increase of sexual vigour.\n\n7.10.1 From Coca to Cocaoine\nWhen he returned to Italy in 1859, he published On the Hygenic and Medicinal Virtues of Coca, a monograph that combined physiological reporting with vivid descriptions of its effect on his mental state.\nThe leaf, he observed, aids digestion and has a central stimulant action on the nervous system. At low doses, this is barely noticeable, but at higher ones it impinges on consciousness to a marked degree. Muscular power is increased: “a new strength gradually drenches one’s organism in every sense, as a sponge soaks itself with water,” and “one feels stronger, more agile, and readier for any kind of work.”\nBy pushing his dose to the practical maximum, repeatedly chewing his way through an ounce of leaf at a time at top speed, Mantegazza was able to achieve “the delirium of coca intoxication.”\nThis was marked by a racing pulse, minor heart palpitations, a surge of “extraordinary happiness,” and, in the mind’s eye, “images that were more bizarre and splendid, in terms of colour, than could ever be imagined.”\nMantegazza’s work brought coca into the purview of German pharmacists, who had for the previous 30 years been working systematically through the alkaloid chemistry of medicinal plants.\n\n7.10.1.1 Isolating Cocaine\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Formula of Cocaine\n\n\n\n\nIn 1859, Friedrich Wohler of Gottingen University procured 25 kg of coca leaf from Lima, which he turned over to his young assistant Albert Niemann.\nNiemann isolated from them a crystalline organic base that was named, according to the convention established by morphine, “cocaıne.”\nNiemann reported that cocaine crystallized in “colorless transparent prisms” and had the bitter taste characteristic of an alkaloid; unsually, it left “a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.”\nIn 1863 an Italian chemist named Angelo Mariani brought onto the market a wine called Vin Mariani which had been treated with coca leaves. By the late 1880s, his product range would include Pate Mariani (cocaine lozenges for catarrh), The Mariani (a concentrated coca tea recommended for long walks), and Pastilles Mariani (for coughing fits).\nPrior to the advent of local anaesthesia, operations on the eye were infrequent and the results most often unsatisfactory. General anaesthesia did not allow the patient to cooperate with the surgeon, e.g., by gazing in a particular direction.\n\n\n\n7.10.2 Medical Uses of Coca\nThe Euro-American enthusiasm for coca quickly cooled in the early twentieth century with the increasing concerns of the addictive properties and poor side effect profiles witnessed with the use of cocaine.\n\nRelief of Gastrointestinal Upset\nCoca leaf tea is taken to combat stomach pain, intestinal spasm, nausea, indigestion, and even constipation and diarrhoea. It is a comprehensive remedy that restores balance to the digestive system. It relieves painful oral sores and aids in the healing of oral lesions. It is used for toothaches as well.\nEnvironmental Stress Treatment\nIt is a remedy for dealing with the stresses of life at high altitude. help the user withstand hypoxia, cold, and hunger. Hand and foot temperatures were lowered in Andean people who used coca. Although the thermal difference between control and experimental subjects was not great, this small difference could be advantageous in decreasing the amount of heat loss in extreme environments.\nHunger Treatment\nCoca chewing is thought to decrease the feeling of hunger in Andean peoples. Chewing coca leaves has been found to elevate blood glucose above the fasting level, which lends scientific credibility to the native belief that coca staves off hunger pains.\nAltitude Illness Treatment\nCoca chewers report less head pain and dizziness associated with working at high altitudes. The percentage of native peoples using coca increases with altitude. Physiological adaptations to cold may be enhanced by coca use.\nThe belief in coca as an uplifting agent for those individuals working in a high altitude environment is not without its naysayers. Many have argued that it is merely a “spurious correlation” between coca chewing and high altitude.\n\n\n\n7.10.3 Cocaine Abuse\nAbuse refers to the use of any drug, primarily by self-administration, in a manner that deviates from the approved social or medical pattern within a given culture.\nThe term “drug abuse” thus conveys the notion of social disapproval.\nThe first epidemic of cocaine use in America occurred during the late 19th century.\nInitially, there were no laws restricting the consumption or sale of cocaine. In fact, cocaine was freely available in drug stores, saloons, from mail-order vendors, and even in grocery stores.\nSoon enough, the ill effects of cocaine became apparent, and by the 1920s cocaine was the most feared of all illicit drugs.\nMost states began enacting laws against cocaine use."

    "text": "7.11 DDT (i.e., Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Formula of DDT\n\n\n\n\nThe full name for DDT is 1-chloro-4-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene.\nDDT enters an insect by dissolving the thin layer of fatty substances that repel water from the creature’s waxy outer skin. Penetrating the layer, DDT reaches the insect’s nerve endings and gradually paralyses vital nerve centres. After a short period of extraordinary excitement, insects sprayed with DDT become progressively paralysed, fall on their backs, and die.\nAs Othmar Zeidler had already synthesised DDT (and also described its properties and developed the methods to manufacture it) in 1874, when Geigy took out a Swiss patent in March 1940, it was for DDT’s use as an insecticide.\n\n7.11.1 Paul Hermann Müller\nPaul was born on 12 January 1899, just outside Basel. He was an average student, and in his formative years, he witnessed two dangerous crises caused by a lack of effective insecticide.\nDuring World War I, Switzerland suffered from serious food shortages. As Switzerland is mountainous, and most of its arable land is pasturage. Switzerland needed to protect its crops from insects, but could not.\nWhile Müller was a student at the University of Basel, the greatest typhus epidemic in history erupted. An estimated 25 – 30 million Russians contracted typhus, and almost three million died.\nAfter he graduate, Müller started work at the J.R. Geigy Corporation (today known as Novartis). Geigy was moving into a new field of research – insecticides. Company chemists discovered a compound that permanently protected woollens from clothes moths and their larvae.\nGeigy’s moth proofing agent was a stomach poison for moths and other keratin-eating insects. It had a strong affinity for woollens, was harmless to warm-blooded animals and people, and had no offensive odour. As a chlorinated hydrocarbon, it was extremely persistent despite exposure to light and moisture.\n\n7.11.1.1 Early Insecticides\nAfter mothproofing wool, the next logical step for Geigy was to invent an insecticide that killed more kinds of pests. Natural insecticides made from plants, including pyrethrum, rotinone and nicotine were expensive, not persistent, and were easily destroyed by light and heat.\nThe most popular insecticide at the time was lead arsenate, and combination of two dangerous poisons. The US used more than ten million pounds of lead arsenate yearly, and residues on West Coast apples had poisoned customers as far away as Great Britain.\nTo Müller, just starting out on his search for an effective insecticide, the situation looked desperate indeed. He realised that “only a particularly cheap or remarkably effective insecticide had any prospects of being used in agriculture.\nGeigy’s research director was interested in gastric poisons that insects of their larvae had to swallow along with their food. Müller realised that not all insects eat in the same way. Many serious diseases are spread by insects that suck human blood for food. Only a contact poison would affect them.\n\n\n\n7.11.2 Searching for an Ideal Insecticide\nMüller outlined the desirable characteristics of an ideal insecticide:\nIt should be toxic to insects but harmless to mammals, fish and plants - it should also:\n\nAct rapidly\nHave no irritating odour\nInexpensive\nIt should affect as many insects as possible\nIt should be chemical stable for a long time\n\nMüller had several clues to guide his search. First, he knew from Henri Martin’s mothproofing work that a chlorinated hydrocarbon worked as a gastric moth poison. Second, he early experiments showed him that compounds with the group CH2Cl has some insecticidal effect. Third a 1934 article in the Journal of the Chemical Society of London described the preparation of diphenyltrichloroethane, which Müller found to be somewhat poisonous to the flies in the glass box.\nTaken together, these hints convinced him that a compound containing chlorine should make a good insecticide.\nBy the autumn of 1939, Müller had tested 349 compounds. For his 350th compound, Müller combined sophorific chloral with cholorobenzene and a catalyst, sulphuric acid. His product was dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).\nSpraying DDT on the flies in his glass cage, Müller was amazed to see them fall helplessly onto their back in ten minutes. In every test he tried, the insects died, although it sometimes took them several hours or days. He was even more astounded when he cage remained poisonous for weeks and killed any fly that touched its walls.\n\n\n7.11.3 Tests on DDT\n\nTest #1\nDDT’s first big field test occurred in Naples (where 90% of the population had lice) on 1 October 1943. Naples had been typhus-free for 30 years – largely due to soap, washable clothing, and public baths – so its inhabitants had no immunity. Within a month a typhus epidemic was underway with a death rate approaching 25%.\n1.3 million people were hand-sprayed, one at a time, with DDT. This kept a person louse-free for several weeks with few to no known side effects. A winter outbreak of typhus had been stopped for the first time in history."

His mother died within days of his birth, and his father, a civic leader and successful trader of dyes and chemicals, rejected him and left his upbringing to various relatives.\nAs a young man, Fritz wanted to become a chemist, but his father insisted that he join the family business. To prepare to enter his father’s business, he studied chemical technology in an alcohol distillery in Hungary, a Solvay soda factory in\nWithin six months of joining his father’s firm, Fritz invested and lost a large amount of the company’s money. At long last, his father acknowledged that his son might be more suited for scientific research than for commerce.\nTo succeed in a university, Haber would have to overcome two obstacles: (1) his spotty chemistry education; and (2) anti-Semitism. German universities rarely promoted Jews to professorships. Since Haber’s family rarely attended synagogue, he pragmatically converted to Christianity in 1892.\nFritz was attracted to a new field, physical chemistry, and enrolled into the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\nIn 1901, Haber married Clara Immerwahr.\nA month into their marriage, Clara became pregnant. Three months after the Habers’ son Hermann was born, Haber left for a five-month trip to the United States. (Haber wasn’t a great husband.)\nIn 1906, at the age of 38, he became a professor. The leading scientific and social problem of the day: How to turn atmospheric nitrogen into desperately needed ammonia for fertilizer.\nOn a mountain hike one hot summer day, Haber would be begin, he stuck his head into a well for a drink of water without noticing that an ox was doing the same thing. Simultaneously lifting their heads, they discovered, to their mutual shock, that they had exchanged heads. That is why Haber would chortle he had the head of a stubborn ox.\n\n7.12.1 Some Background\nEurope’s population had tripled over the past 200 years as public relief expanded, the severity of epidemics declined, and food crops were diversified. Because of this, Europe feared that it would run out of food.\nHydroelectric power plants and local coal gas and coke factories produced small amounts of ammonia that could be used to make fertilizer for crops, but the quantities did not come close to meeting farmers’ needs. Indeed, without North American and Ukrainian grain shipments and without fertilizer shipments from Peruvian guano, Europe in the early 1900s might have experienced another famine like the Irish disaster of the 1840s.\nEurope looked to chemists to feed its growing populations. William Crookes stated, “It is the chemist who must come to the rescue of the threatened communities. It is through the laboratory that starvation may be ultimately turned to plenty.”\nChemists knew they had to turn the nitrogen in air into ammonia, but they did not have a solution. The two nitrogen atoms that make up the a molecule of nitrogen are held together by one of the strongest known chemical bonds, and no one could break the nitrogen molecule apart long enough to make ammonia.\n\n\n7.12.2 Incentives\n\n7.12.2.1 Economic\nThe fact that Germany depended on imported fertilizer more than any other country gave it a special stake in the problem. The industrialization of Germany’s sugar beet and potato farms was intimately linked to its use of natural fertilizer, especially nitrogen compounds from the marine bird manure imported from Peru, Chile, and Bolivia. Yet experts predicted that Europe would exhaust South America’s guano in 30 years.\n\n\n7.12.2.2 Military\nNitrogen compounds are also used in explosives. In 1900, when the Boer war broke out between German and English immigrants in South Africa, Anglo-German relations soured. In the event of a European war, Britain’s navy would block the import of guano Germany needed to make nitrates for explosives.\nOstwald and Walther Nernst, the world’s two leading physical chemists worked on nitrogen fixation, but got nowhere.\n\n\n\n7.12.3 Conditions Required for Ammonia Production\nHaber had knowledge of industrial chemistry, and was able to blend the talents of skilled technicians, industrialists and scientists from different disciplines.\nRobert Le Rossignol developed the seals needed to maintain high pressures in an experimental chamber. Friedrich Kirchenbauer built precision equipment needed for the reaction.\nIn his Nobel Prize speech, he thanked them, and shared his prize money with both men.\nHaber and Rossignol discovered that hydrogen and nitrogen would stay combined only under extraordinarily harsh conditions: temperatures of 200°C and atmospheric pressure 200 times stronger than normal.\nSuch conditions were unheard of at the time, yet even they produced ammonia extremely slowly. To speed up the process, Haber and Rossignol used osmium and uranium as catalysts.\nLater, it was found that a mixture of iron and metal oxides worked best. Haber patented his process.\n\n\n7.12.4 Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute\nIn 1910, Haber was offered a job in Berlin at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry. Leopold Koppel offered to finance the Institute with two conditions: (1) the Kaiser must thank him publicly; and (2) Fritz Haber must be the institute’s director. Haber three other conditions: (1) he must be a tenured stated official with power to run the institute; (2) earn 15,000 marks yearly; and (3) live free in an institute villa.\nBASF opened its factory in 1913. The Haber-Bosch process remains the cheapest and most efficient method of turning atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can use.\nHaber’s 1913 contract with BASF gave him 1.5 pfennigs for every kilogram of ammonia produced. By the mid-1920s, BASF had paid him enough to start rumours that the Habers dined on gold plates.\nHe became close friends with Albert Einstein. During Einstein’s divorce from his first wife, Mileva, Haber drew up Einstein’s financial arrangement with her, promised her the Nobel Prize money that Einstein was expected to win, and mediated between Mileva and Einstein.\nHaber’s own family life suffered as he became more famous.\n\n\n7.12.5 Chemical Weapons\nClara rejected their newfound wealth, and preferred a semi-socialistic lifestyle.\nWorld War I broke out, and the military asked Haber to find a chemical substitute for traditional munitions. France was contemplating the use of tear gas, which is not fatal.\nThe Hague Peace Conference of 1899 and 1907 banned the use of unusual, new weapons that might cause unnecessary suffering.\nHaber believed that poison gas would be more humane than high explosives, and no worse than flying shrapnel.\nHaber agreed to find a chemical weapon, and invented poison gas. He personally directed the burial of 6,000 cylinders of liquid chlorine along a 1½ mile line near Ypres, Belgium.\nOn 22 April 1915, the Germans opened all the canisters simultaneously, releasing 150 tons of chlorine within ten minutes.\nVomiting and coughing in violent spams, the soldiers retreated in panic. Chlorine corrodes the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, and lungs, and can asphyxiate its victims.\nSeven thousand people at Ypres were poisoned, and 350 died. The Emperor promoted, by imperial decree, Haber to the rank of captain.\nClara pleaded with Haber to stop his poison gas work. She was horrified by the experiments conducted on animals. Early in the war, an experiment in the lab exploded after Haber left the room. A young physicist, Otto Sackur, one of Clara’s classmates, was killed. Haber later found a job at the institute for Sackur’s daughter.\n\n7.12.5.1 Boycotting Poisonous Gas\nThe Nobel prize unleashed an international storm of protest.\nExcept for one Englishman, the non-German winners boycotted the ceremonies, primarily because of Haber. Press reaction to the prizes was extraordinarily hostile. Many of the German winners had signed the manifesto supporting the invasion of Belgium.\nAllied countries singled out Haber because his ammonia process had lengthened the war by four years. The 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibited chemical and biological weapons.\n\n\n\n7.12.6 Haber’s Nobel Prize\nSackur’s death disturbed Clara profoundly. The week after the poison gas attack at Ypres, Clara gave her husband the ultimatum – stop working with poison gas or she would commit suicide.\nOn 1 May 1915, he threw a dinner party to celebrate his success. At dawn (2 May 1915), Clara shot herself in the heart. 2.5 years later, Haber married Charlotte Nathan.\nWhen Germany surrendered, Haber plunged into a severe depression. A year after Germany’s surrender, Haber won the 1918 Nobel prize for turning nitrogen into ammonia for fertilizer. Nothing was said about the use of ammonia in explosives.\n\n\n7.12.7 Searching for Gold in Seawater\nHaber was deeply disheartened by Germany’s defeat. The Versailles Treaty had levied a 132-million-mark indemnity. Haber searched the seas for gold.\nAccepting contemporary estimates that seawater naturally contained six milligrams of gold per metric ton, he figured that the oceans must contain eight million tons of gold, and extraction would be economically feasible.\nHaber and Johannes Jaenicke started sampling seawater, and five years later, he found that contemporary estimates of seawater’s gold content were a thousand times too high. Haber gave up the idea.\nWhen Hitler became chancellor in 1933, he issued an order that no Jews would be allowed in civil service.\nHaber was exempt from this due to his civil service during World War I. However, his employees were not. 75% of them were Jewish, and would have to be dismissed. Haber took a stand and resigned on 30 April 1933.\n\n“My most important goals in life are that I not die as a German citizen and that I not bequeath to my children and grandchildren the civil rights of second-class citizenship, as German law now demands that they accept and endure on account of their Jewish grandparents and great-grandparents. The second thing that’s important to me is to spend my last years in a scientific community of people, with honour but without heavy duties.”\n– Sir William Pope\n\nHaber accepted the invitation of Sir William Pope to join him at Cambridge University. The invitation was arranged by Haber’s former foes – Harold Hartley and Frederick Donnan of the Imperial College.\n\n\n7.12.8 Haber’s Death\n\n“Haber’s significance for science and its nurturing is not remotely exhausted by his own scientific works and with those of his school. He was not merely a man of science and technology; he was also highly competent in matters of organisation and financial management … Haber was a Jew, as were the overwhelming majority of his colleagues. This made conflict with the National Socialist state inevitable.”\n– Speech on Haber in 28 June, 1934\n\nOn 29 January 1934, Haber collapsed with severe heart pains in a hotel room at Basel, Switzerland. Later that day, he suffered a heart attack, and died within a few hours.\nHe was buried in a Basel cemetery. At his request, the body of his first wife, Clara Immerwahr was buried next to his. On 29 January 1935, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society held a memorial service for Haber.\nDuring World War II, the Nazis used the pesticide Zyklon B in concentration gas chambers.\n\n7.12.8.1 Note on Zyklon B\nZyklon B was not invented by Fritz Haber. Walter Heerdt, Bruno Emil Tesch and Gerhard Peters invented it in 1922.\nIt was an insecticide used in Germany before and during World War II to disinfect ships, barracks, clothing, warehouses, factories, granaries, and more.\nIt was produced in crystal form, creating amethyst-blue pellets. Since these Zyklon B pellets turned into a highly poisonous gas (hydrocyanic acid, HCN) when exposed to air, they were stored and transported in hermetically-sealed, metal canisters."

    "text": "7.13 Tetraethyl Lead (i.e., TEL)\nMidgley was born on 18 May 1889. He majored in mechanical engineering in Cornell University. He worked for Charles Kettering, the inventor of the electrical self-starting ignition. Kettering assigned Midgley the problem of engine knock.\nHe improvised a high-speed camera to photograph the engine through a quartz window in a cylinder, and showed that part of the fuel inside the engine cylinder was exploding prematurely.\nBy chance, he found that iodine eliminated knock, but was too expensive, and it corroded and clogged the engine.\nOn 9 December 1921, tetraethyl lead, Pb(C2H5)4, was found to eliminate knock. Tetraethyl lead (TEL) went on sale on 1 February 1923.\nMany workers died in the process of manufacturing TEL, and General Motors paid the U.S. Bureau of Mines to conduct a study. The Bureau agreed to refer only to the trade name “Ethyl” without using the scientific term that included “lead”.\nBecause of the deaths in the manufacture of TEL, it became an occupational, rather than a broader, environmental issue.\n\n7.13.1 Pro-Lead versus Anti-Lead\nThe U.S. Surgeon General convened a hearing, and two camps formed.\nThe men engaged in industry, chemists, and engineers, take it as a matter of course that a little thing like industrial poisoning should not be allowed to stand in the way of industrial advance. On the other hand, the sanitary experts take as a matter of course that the first consideration is the health of the people.\nThe pro-lead camp – the petrochemical and automobile industries – represented the corporate backbone of the United States, and had the upper hand.\nThe Surgeon General’s committee completed its study, and it was announced that TEL would add less lead to the atmosphere than house paint, production and distribution of TEL was resumed.\nStandard Oil petrol stations put on the sign: “Ethyl is Back.” The medical adviser of Standard Oil strongly urged corporate president Walter Teagle to abandon TEL, but his advice was unheeded.\nWithin two decades of the introduction of TEL, the octane rating of petrol rose from 55 to 75.\nBy 1928, Kettering was in charge of the General Motors research department, and Frigidaire was part of GM. Every refrigerant known at the time (e.g., sulphur dioxide and ammonia) was toxic, inflammable, or both.\n\n\n7.13.2 Refridgeration\n\n“At least fifteen and perhaps more persons died in recent months in Chicago from gases used in artificial refrigeration. … Four persons have been victims of the gas [methyl chloride] in the last ten days in Chicago. Dr. Kegel [Health Commissioner] compiled a list of twelve persons who, he said, had been made ill by the gas, and a list of seven who had died from it in the last few weeks.”\n– New York Times, 2 July, 1929\n\nIf refrigeration and air-conditioning were to become popular, a safe refrigerant would have to be found.\nMethyl chloride, another refrigerant, proved lethal in some apartments in the 1920s when pipes connecting water-cooling equipment to refrigerators upstairs leaked.\n\n7.13.2.1 CFCs\nMidgley identified a new class of potential compounds: the chlorofluorocarbons, later nicknamed CFCs, and trademarked Freon by Du Pont. Dichlorodifluoromethane was found to be noninflammable and nontoxic. It was later called R-12 (for “Refrigerant-12”).\nAt the American Chemical Society annual meeting in April 1930, Midgley demonstrated R-12 by lighting a candle, inhaling the R-12, holding it in his lungs for a moment, and the slowly exhaling, blowing candle flames out.\nAir-conditioning and refrigeration took off!\nSafe refrigeration revolutionised medicine by making vaccinations effective and by reducing food poisoning and diarrheal diseases. All vaccines must be refrigerated during shipment and storage.\nBefore refrigeration, the failure rate of vaccination was high as vaccines kept at room temperature were effective for less than a week.\nMany types of bacteria thrive in unrefrigerated food, and in summer, milk kept more than 12 hours had to be boiled. Convenience was another advantage of refrigeration.\n\n\n\n7.13.3 Refridgeration Impacts\nSafe refrigeration revolutionised medicine by making vaccinations effective and by reducing food poisoning and diarrheal diseases. All vaccines must be refrigerated during shipment and storage.\nBefore refrigeration, the failure rate of vaccination was high as vaccines kept at room temperature were effective for less than a week.\nMany types of bacteria thrive in unrefrigerated food, and in summer, milk kept more than 12 hours had to be boiled.\nConvenience was another advantage of refrigeration.\n\n7.13.3.1 Impacts of CFCs\nAt the University of California, Irvine, Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina discovered that CFCs could deplete Earth’s atmospheric ozone layer, which blocks the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays. The scientists reported their findings in 1974. Rowland and Molina convinced sceptical industrialists, policymakers, and the public of the danger of CFCs.\nThe scientists’ advocacy – and the discovery by other researchers that the ozone layer over the Antarctic was thinning – led to worldwide phase-out of CFCs and the development of safer alternatives. Rowland, Molina and Paul J. Crutzen shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n\n\n7.13.4 Midgley’s Death\nIn September 1940, Midgley contracted polio, paralysing him from the waist down. He wrote:\n\n“I have been spending my spare moments in bed figuring out the statistical probability of a 51-year-old male catching poliomyelis, as I have, and this comes out to be substantially equal to the chances of drawing a certain individual card from a stack of playing cards as high as the Empire State Building. It was my tough luck to draw it.”\n– Midgley in writing\n\nHe could sit up for only for short periods of time, and found travel difficult.\nOn the morning of 2 November 1944, Carrie Midgley found Midgley dead. At 55, he had strangled on the overhead ropes and pulleys that he had designed for getting in and out of bed. His friends spread the story that he had become accidentally entangled, and the story stuck for 50 years.\nDeath and cemetery certificates, however, reveal what must have been obvious to his friends – a mechanical engineer of Midgley’s prowess would not have accidentally strangled on his own invention. In despair, Midgley had carefully planned his death."

(Urine naturally contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates.) Brand called the substance he had discovered phosphorus (“light bearer”) because it was luminous, glowing in the dark.\nAlthough Brand kept his process a secret, phosphorus was discovered independently in 1680 by Robert Boyle."

In 1884 he became Cavendish Professor of Physics, succeeding Lord Rayleigh.\n\n“I regard the atom as containing a large number of smaller bodies which I will call corpuscles; … In the normal atom, this assemblage of corpuscles forms a system which is electrically neutral. Though the individual corpuscles behave like negative ions, yet when they are assembled in a neutral atom the negative effect is balanced by something which causes the space through which the corpuscles are spread to act as if it had a charge of positive electricity equal in amount to the sum of the negative charges on the corpuscles.”\n– JJ Thomson on the Plum Pudding Model (1899)\n\nHe discovered the electron in 1897. He was also a gifted teacher, and seven of his research assistants and his son won Nobel Prizes in physics.\n\n8.1.1 Corpuscles and Thomson’s Plum Pudding Model\nThomson posited something which behaves as if it had a positive charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Image of a Corpuscle\n\n\n\n\nBut he was certain about the overall system, namely the atom is a spatial domain filled with numerous negative corpuscles whose total charge is neutralised somehow by the spatial positive electrification.\nBetween 1904 and about 1910, Thomson’s model of the atom was generally accepted as the best available atomic theory.\nIt became popularly known as the plum-pudding atomic model.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional British Plum Pudding\n\n\n\n\nDespite its name, this pudding contains raisins rather than plums.

It carries a negative charge which is considered the basic charge of electricity.\nAn electron is nearly massless. It has a rest mass of \\(9.1 \\times 10^{-28}\\) gram, which is only 0.0005 the mass of a proton.\nThe electron was the first subatomic particle discovered. It was identified in 1897 by J.J. Thomson during investigations of cathode rays. His discovery of electrons, which he initially called corpuscles, played a pivotal role in revolutionizing knowledge of atomic structure."

    "text": "8.2 Wilhelm Röntgen\nWilhelm Conrad Röntgen was born on 27 March 1845, at Lennep in the Lower Rhine Province of Germany. Röntgen, professor of physics at the University of Wurzburg, discovered X-rays while experimenting with high-voltage electricity.\nWorking in his darkened lab, he sent an electric current through a cathode ray vacuum tube. Out of the corner of his eye, he glimpsed a bright, greenish-yellow glow on a piece of paper on a nearby bench. He concluded that a new type of ray was being emitted from the tube.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn X-ray of Anna Bertha’s Hand\n\n\n\n\nRöntgen found that the new ray could pass through most substances casting shadows of solid objects. He also discovered that the ray could pass through the tissue of humans, but not bones and metal objects.\nOne of Röntgen’s first experiments late in 1895 was a film of the hand of his wife, Anna Bertha. (Hands were a popular subject of early X-rays.)\nSchuster recognised the medical value of X-rays.\nThe potential medical applications are why Röntgen decided not to patent X-rays.\nEarly X-rays were called:\n\nRadiographs\nRoentgenograms\nRoentgenographs\n\nX-rays quickly proved useful as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool as it allowed physicians their first look inside the body without surgery.\n\n8.2.1 First Dental X-Ray\nFourteen days after Röntgen’s first publication on X-ray (28 December 1895), Otto Walkhoff captured the first dental X-ray of his own teeth. He asked Fritz Giesel, a professor of physics to assist him – he experienced a 25-minute exposure.\n\n“I felt tremendously happy when I saw the results. It was when I weighed up the importance of Röntgen’s discovery for future dentistry.”\n– Fritz Giesel\n\nFritz Giesel eventually lost his hair. Today, the exposure to X-ray in in the order of milliseconds.\nIn the early days of X-ray, the exposure of 25 to 30 minutes. Patients suffered the after effects of the exposure in the following forms:\nloss of hair, skin burn, skin blisters, fingernail growth stopped, bloodshot eyes, impaired vision, dermatitis, itching of the skin, basal cell carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma.\n\n\n8.2.2 Émil Herman Grubbé\nIn 1896, barely a year after Röntgen had discovered his X-rays, a 21-year-old Chicago medical student, Emil Grubbé, had the inspired notion of using X-rays to treat cancer.\nGrubbé had worked in a factory in Chicago that produced X-ray tubes, and he had built a crude version of a tube for his own experiments.\nHaving encountered X-ray, exposed factory workers with peeling skin and nails – his own hands had also become chapped and swollen from repeated exposures – Grubbé extended the logic of this cell death to tumours.\nIn 1896, in a tube factory in Chicago, Grubbé began to bombard Rose Lee, and elderly woman with breast cancer, with radiation, using an improvised X-ray tube.\nLee’s cancer had relapsed after a mastectomy, and the tumour had exploded into a painful mass in her breast.\nThe tumour ulcerated, tightened, and shrank, producing the first response in the history of X-ray therapy. A few months after her initial treatment, the cancer metastasized to her spine, brain and liver.\nX-rays could only be used to treat cancer locally, with little effect on tumours that had already metastasized.\nA new branch of cancer medicine, radiation oncology, was born. Grubbé succumbed to the deadly effects of chronic radiation. By the mid-1940s, his fingers had been amputated one-by-one to remove necrotic and gangrenous bones, and his face was cut up in repeated operations to remove radiation-induced tumours and premalignant warts. In 1960, he died in Chicago, with multiple forms of cancer that had spread throughout his body."

    "text": "8.3 Ernest Rutherford\nErnest Rutherford was born on August 30, 1871 at a small town called Bridgewater near Nelson in New Zealand’s South Island.\nhe was able to win another scholarship to study from 1890 to 1894 and joined Canterbury College of the University of New Zealand in Christchurch.\nHe got his bachelors degree in 1892 and masters degree in 1893.\nAt this point Rutherford set his eyes on getting a scholarship of the Royal Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851, which would enable him to study anywhere in the British-ruled countries.\nThis was not easy as only one scholarship was given every two years to a New Zealand student who had to be on the roll in the University at the time of applying for it.\nTherefore Rutherford went back to Canterbury College in 1894 and completed BSc degree with geology, chemistry and some research work.\nRutherford decided to work with J.J. Thomson, who was then the Director of Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University.\nRutherford left New Zealand in 1895 and joined J.J. Thomson. He became the first non-Cambridge graduate to be admitted for PhD at Cambridge University.\nRutherford discovered alpha and beta rays in 1898.\nRutherford accepted an invitation to the Macdonald Chair of Physics (1898-1907) at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and moved there without completing the PhD degree.\n\n8.3.1 Discovering Half-Lives\nWorking with Frederick Soddy in 1902-03, Rutherford identified the phenomenon of radioactive half-life and formulated the still-accepted explanation of radioactivity: each decay of the atoms of radioactive materials signifies the transmutation of a parent element into a daughter, with each type of atom having its own transformation period.\nA succession of such transformations forms a radioactive series.\n\n\n8.3.2 Geiger-Marsden Experiments\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup of a Typical Geiger-Marsden Experiment\n\n\n\n\nThese experiments provided the first experimental evidence that led to the discovery of the nucleus of the atom as a small, dense, and positively charged atomic core. The discovery involved a series of experiments performed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden under Ernest Rutherford.\nWith Geiger and Marsden’s experimental evidence, Rutherford deduced a model of the atom, discovering the atomic nucleus. His “Rutherford Model” (or solar system model, or planetary model), outlining a tiny positively charged atomic centre surrounded by orbiting electrons, was a pivotal scientific discovery revealing the structure of the atoms that comprise all the matter in the universe.\n\n\n8.3.3 Atom Interior\nThe experimental evidence involved the scattering of a particle beam after passing through a thin gold foil obstruction. The particles used for the experiment – alpha particles – are positive, dense, and can be emitted by a radioactive source.\nErnest Rutherford discovered the alpha particle as a positive radioactive emission in 1899. As these alpha particles have a significant positive charge, any significant potential interference would have to be caused by a large concentration of electrostatic force somewhere in the structure of the atom.\n\n\n\n\n\nElectron Scattering\n\n\n\n\nThe scattering of an 𝛼-particle beam should have been impossible according to the plum pudding model of the atom. This model held that atoms were comprised of a sphere of positive electric charge dotted by the presence of negatively charged electrons.\nThis model lacked the presence of any significant concentration of electromagnetic force that could tangibly affect any alpha particles passing through atoms. As such, α-particles should show no signs of scattering when passing through thin matter.\n\n8.3.3.1 Explanations\nThe alpha particles had run into huge concentrations of positive charge and were repelled. Rutherford explained that the atom composed almost entirely of empty space. It had no solid boundary and its outer limits were defined only by the movement of its outermost electrons, while at the centre lay the atomic nucleus.\n\n“…It was as if you fired a 15-inch naval shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. I realised that this scattering backwards must be the result of a single collision, and when I made calculations I saw that it was impossible to get anything of that order of magnitude unless you took a system in which the mass of the atom was concentrated in a minute nucleus”\n– Rutherford’s Explanation\n\nIn relation to the atom, the nucleus was a mere speck in a cavernous void. The nucleus is so small that only 1 particle in 8000 would collide with it. It was like a fly in a cathedral.\n\n\n\n8.3.4 In the Cavendish Laboratory\nAfter the war, in 1919, Rutherford moved to Cambridge University, succeeding J.J. Thomson, as Cavendish Professor of Physics and the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory. Soon, he found that nuclei can be disintegrated artificially by bombarding with alpha particles, and thus cause transmutations. By this means he converted nitrogen nuclei into oxygen nuclei.\n\n“He (Rutherford) had … a volcanic energy, interest, enthusiasm and an immense capacity for work. He had the most astonishing insight into physical processes, and in a few remarks he would illuminate a whole subject. There is a stock phrase-‘to throw light on a subject’. This is exactly what Rutherford did. To work with him was a continual joy and wonder. He seemed to know the answer before the experiment was made, and was ready to push on the irresistible urge to the next. (He was nicknamed ‘crocodile’, which cannot turn its head…must always go forward with all devouring jaws open.) He was indeed a pioneer – the word he often used – at his best exploring an unknown country, pointing out the really important features and leaving the rest for others to survey at leisure. He was, in my opinion, the greatest experimental physicist since Faraday.\nIn appearance Rutherford was more like a successful businessman or Dominion farmer than a scholar … he was of massive build, had a moustache and a ruddy complexion. He wore lose, rather baggy clothes, except on formal occasions. A little under six feet in height, he was noticeable but by no means impressive. It seemed impossible for Rutherford to speak softly.\nHis whisper could be heard all over the room, and in any company he dominated through the sheer volume and nature of his voice, which remained tinged with antipodean flavour despite his many years in Canada and England. His laughter was equally formidable. Rutherford would not hesitate making fun of the Nobel Committee decision to choose him for the Chemistry Prize instead of the Physics Prize.”\n– James Chadwick on Ernest Rutherford\n\nHe won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his “investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances.”\n\n\n8.3.5 Rutherford’s Death\nRutherford died on 19 October 1937 in Cambridge. His ashes were buried in Westminster Abbey close to the tombs of Sir Isaac Newton and Lord Kelvin."

    "section": "8.4 The Curies",
    "text": "8.4 The Curies\n\n“Sometimes, I had to spend a whole day mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the day’s end. Other days, on the contrary, the work would be a most minute and delicate fractional crystallization, in the effort to concentrate the radium.\nOur precious products … were arranged on tables and boards; from all sides we could see their slightly luminous silhouettes, and these gleamings, which seemed suspended in the darkness, stirred us with ever new emotion and enchantment.”\n– Marie Curie in her autobiography\n\nAwarded a combined total of six Nobel Prizes, the celebrated Curie family’s collective work and momentous achievements alone make their lives fascinating. But the lesser-known side of their story includes the controversy, the drama, the scandal, and the tragedy that surrounds them.\nNow, the first full-scale biography of the Curies provides a well-rounded, honest look at both the private and professional lives of the world’s most gifted scientific family.\n\n8.4.1 Pierre Curie\nPierre was born in Paris on 15 May 1859. He was the second son of Eugène Curie and Sophie Claire Depouilly (his elder brother was Jacques).\nHis grandfather, Paul François Curie, had been a surgeon in the Military Hospital of Paris. Disenchanted with conventional medicine, he pioneered a new system of healing, called homeopathy, writing a book about it, entitled, Practice of Homeopathy.\nHis father, Eugène Curie was a doctor. His mother, Sophie Claire Depouilly was the daughter of a once wealthy cloth manufacturer in Puteaux.\nPierre’s parents, and later, his brother, taught him at home. Throughout the elementary and high school years, they gave him a grounding in biology, chemistry, physics and geometry. He made up for his lack of schooling in literature and history by reading many of the books in his father’s large library. Pierre could only learn a subject thoroughly by intense concentration, which he found impossible in a disturbing environment.\nWhen Pierre was fourteen, his father realised that he was exceptional at math, especially spatial geometry, and hired Professor Albert Bazille to teach him advanced mathematics.\nBazille inspired him to such intense effort that despite his early casual home schooling, he matriculated at the prestigious Sorbonne at 16. There, in just two years, he got a degree in physics. Then at 18, because his financial help was needed at home, instead of pursuing a doctorate, he began to work as a physics lab assistant at the Sorbonne. Jacques was already employed as an assistant in the mineralogy department.\nAs a pacifist, having seen the horrors of war, Pierre avoided military service by agreeing to spend ten years working in public education – something he had already started to do as a lab assistant. He liked reading novels. Pierre and Jacques already knew that crystals heated in a fire attracted ash and wood to their surfaces like magnets.\nKelvin had also discovered that when certain crystals were heated, they generated electricity – this was known as pyroelectricity. The two brothers proved that pressure on some crystals had the same effect.\n\n\n8.4.2 Discovering the Piezoelectric Effect\nJacques and Pierre Curie announced their discovery of the piezoelectric (from the Greek piezine, ‘to press’) effect to the French Academy of Science on 2 August 1880. Today, piezoelectric devices are ubiquitous. E.g., all quartz watches and clocks are based on piezoelectricity.\n\n“Their experiment led the two young physicists to a great success: the discovery of the hitherto unknown piezoelectricity, […]. This was by no means a chance discovery. It was the result of much reflection on the symmetry of crystalline matter which enabled the brothers to foresee the possibility of such polarization. […] With experimentation rare for their age, the young men succeeded in making a complete study of the new phenomenon, established the conditions of symmetry necessary to its production in crystals, and state its remarkably simple quantitative laws, as well as its absolute magnitude for certain crystals.”\n– Marie Curie\n\nThe use of the phenomenon outside the laboratory began 35 years after its discovery during the first world war, in a search for a device to detect German submarines. The sonar, the product of this research, was put into use only after the war had ended.\n\n\n8.4.3 Marie Salomea Sklodowska\nMarie was born in Warsaw on 7 November 1867. Her parents, Vladislav and Bronislava, already had three daughters (Sophie, Bronia and Hela) and a son (Joseph). They grew up in a police state under the autocratic Russian Czar Alexander II. He was determined to enslave the intellectual and middle-class Poles who had opposed his rule, and to eradicate their language, culture, and history. Russian became the official language, Russian officials and teachers replaced the Poles, and Poland disappeared from maps to reappear as Vistula Land or Vistula Country. She danced joyfully in the classroom after hearing that Czar Alexander II had been killed by an assassin on 13 March 1881.\nMarie’s father was a professor and assistant principal of a boy’s school, taught physics and mathematics, which he loved. Her mother was a headmistress and director of a prestigious girls’ boarding school.\nHe established a boys’ boarding school in the family home, taking in two or three boarders at first, then five, eight, ten. He gave lodging, food, and private instruction to these young boys, chosen from among his pupils. The house was transformed into a noisy barracks and intimacy vanished from family life.\nWhen Marie was nine, one of the boarders caught typhus and 14-year-old Sophie was infected with the disease, which killed her. Marie was stunned by the death of her brilliant and high-spirited sister.\nAt ten, Marie left home to attend a private boarding school. Her teacher Mlle Antonina Tupalska, who doted on her, taught Polish history in Polish – a practice forbidden by the Russian authorities. Although Marie was two years younger than most of her 24 classmates, she beat them all in history, literature, German, and French.\n\n\n8.4.4 Marie as a Governess\nAfter a year, Marie decided to leave home to be a governess in a lawyer’s family. It was a bad experience for her as she did not get along well with the wife.\nBronia wanted to study medicine in Paris, and raised enough money for the journey and tuition. But when she reached Paris, she hadn’t enough money to survive on even in the inexpensive Latin Quarter. Marie, too, wanted to study in Paris, and so they made an agreement. Marie would accept another job, also as a governess. From her salary, she promised to subsidize Bronia until she graduated and got a job as a doctor. Then the roles would be reversed.\n\n“Today we had another scene because she did not want to get up at the usual hour. In the end, I was obliged to take her calmly by the hand and pull her out of bed. I was boiling inside. You can’t imagine what such little things do to me: such a piece of nonsense can make me ill for several hours. Bur I had to get the better of her.”\n– Marie Curie\n\nHer experience in the Zorawski house was much better. Most evenings were devoted to her own studies – literature and sociology – but eventually, she decided that if she ever got to Paris she would focus on mathematics and physics.\n\n\n8.4.5 Casimir Zorawski\nMarie fell in love with Casimir Zorawski, the eldest son of her employers. He asked her to marry him, and she expected his family to be pleased. But when Casimir asked for his parents’ approval to marry Marie, his parents disapproved. The idea of their son marrying a poor working woman was intolerable. In one instant, the social barriers went up, insurmountable.\nThe fact that Marie was of good family, that she was cultivated, brilliant, and of irreproachable reputation, the fact that her father was honourably known in Warsaw – none of that counted. One does not marry a governess!\n\n“If men don’t want to marry poor young girls, then let them go to the devil!”\n– Marie to Joseph in writing\n\nSubjected to his parents’ disapproval, Casimir did not fight for the woman he loved. Heartbroken and humiliated, Marie wanted to leave immediately, but she remembered the pact she made with her sister – to send almost half her salary to support Bronia’s studies in Paris. So she continued on as the family’s governess, trying hard to hide her anger and bitter disappointment.\n\n“Everybody says I have changed a great deal, physically and spiritually, during my stay in Szczuki. This is not surprising. I was barely eighteen when I came here and what have I not been through! There have been moments which I shall certainly count among the most cruel of my life. I feel everything very violently, with a physical violence, and then I give myself a shaking, the vigor of my nature conquers, and it seems to me that I am coming out of a nightmare […] First principle: never to let one’s self be beaten down by persons or events. I count the hours and days that separate me from the holidays and my departure to my own people. There is also the need of new impressions, of change, or movement and life, which seizes me sometimes with such force that I want to fling myself into the greatest follies, if only to keep my life from being eternally the same. Fortunately, I have so much work to do that these attacks seize me pretty rarely.”\n– Marie to Henrietta in writing\n\n\n\n8.4.6 Improving Finances\nOn the home front, there were developments. Her father took on a job as director of a reform school near Warsaw. It paid well, and he was able to help Bronia and Marie.\nBronia told their father that she could live on 32 rubles a month and to save eight of the forty he usually sent her, and give to Marie instead, which he did. For the first time, Marie was able to save toward her future life in France.\nIn July 1890, Marie left the Zorawskys, and began planning for her own future. Her next job was with the Fuchs family.\n\n“I dreamed of Paris as of redemption, but the hope of going there left me a long time ago. And now that the possibility is offered to me, I do not know what to do … I am afraid to speak of it to Father. I believe our plan of living together next year is close to his heart, and he clings to it; I want to give him a little happiness in his old age. And on the other hand my heart breaks when I think of ruining my abilities, which must have been worth something.”\n– Marie in writing\n\nMarie had worked for less than a year when Bronia informed her that they would soon graduate as doctors, after which they intended to marry. If Marie could save a few hundred rubles to pay for her fees at the Sorbonne, she could then live with them for free, meals included.\n\n\n8.4.7 Marie’s Third Job as a Governess\n\n“Marie has a secret about her future, of which she is to speak to me at length … To tell you the truth, I can well imagine what it has to do with, and I don’t myself know whether I should be glad or sorry. If my foresight is accurate, the same disappointments, coming from the same person who have already caused them to her, are awaiting her. And yet if it is a question of building a life according to her own feeling, and of making two people happy, that is worth the trouble of facing them perhaps. Your invitation to Paris, which fell upon her in such unexpected fashion, has given her a fever and added to her disorder … If she does not come back to me completely cured, I should oppose her departure, because of the hard conditions she would find herself in during the winter in Paris … without ever mentioning the fact that it would be very painful for me to separate from her, but this consideration is obviously secondary. I learned with great joy that Casimir (Bronia’s husband) is doing well . How funny it would be if each of you had a Casimir.”\n– Letter from father to Bronia.\n\nDuring their walks in the mountains, Casimir merely repeated that he could not overcome his snobbish parents’ opposition. And Marie made the final break with her parting shot, telling him that if he couldn’t resolve the problem, it was not for her to teach him how to do it.\n\n“It would restore me spiritually after the cruel trials I have been through this summer which will have an influence on my whole life … I am so nervous at the prospect of my departure that I cant speak of anything else until I get your answer … I promise that I shall not be a bore or create disorder. I implore you to answer me, but very frankly.”\n– Marie Curie\n\nAs Casimir was a lost cause, Marie wrote to Bronia (now married and pregnant) telling her that she would join her in Paris if her sister could feed her without depriving herself.\n\n\n8.4.8 Inadequate Academic Grounding\nBronia and her husband were at Gare du Nord to receive Marie when she arrived in Paris. She began her studies at the Sorbonne’s Faculty of Sciences on 3 November 1891, one of only 23 women among 1,825 students. Men outnumbered women almost a hundred to one.\nTo her dismay, her French failed her when a professor spoke quickly, and she could not grasp entire sentences. In addition, the physics and mathematics she had studied alone or in correspondence with her father was not up to the standard of her classmates education in French schools.\nMarie took her physics exam in July 1893, and got the highest score.\nNever before in the history of the Sorbonne, had a woman, and a foreigner, top the physics class. Marie was eager to return to the Sorbonne to get a master’s degree in math. But her savings were exhausted, her father had already sacrificed too much, and Bronia, with a young child, couldn’t be expected to extend their help for another year.\nThe Alexandrovitch Scholarship Fund came to the rescue with 600 rubles, enough to support her in Paris until she got a math degree.\n\n\n8.4.9 Meeting Pierre\n\n“Marie was hired by the Society for the Encouragement of National Industries to test the magnetic properties of various steels. But the Sorbonne’s crowded physics lab hadn’t room for the equipment she needed for the tests. A friend, Professor Kowalski, who had known her since her days as a governess in Poland invited her to meet someone he thought could help her.”\n-– Pierre Curie.\n\nAfter meeting at Joseph Kowalski’s apartment, they met again at the French Society of Physics, and at his lab.\nPierre completed his doctoral thesis in March 1895, titled “Magnetic Properties of Bodies at Diverse Temperatures”. After this, he persuaded Marie to marry him.\nThe were married on 26 July 1895 at Sceaux’s town hall. On 12 September 1897, Dr. Eugene Curie delivered Irène Curie. Late in 1897, Marie decided not to seek a teaching job right away, but to study for a doctorate. If successful, she would be the first woman in France, and possible the whole of Europe, with a Ph.D. in physics.\n\n\n8.4.10 PhD Topics\nThe Curies agreed that a fundamental study of the nature of uranium would be an engrossing subject for Marie’s PhD thesis. Professor Gabriel Lippman delivered her first paper on her research at the weekly meeting of the French Academy of Sciences, on 12 April 1898, titled, “Rays Emitted by Compounds of Uranium and of Thorium”.\nMarie was intrigued by the erratic results from testing pitchblende. She found that its radioactivity was four times more intense that justified by its uranium content. She repeated her experiment 20 times, but got the same results.\nShe suspected that she had found a new element.\n\n“The radiation from pitchblende that I couldn’t explain comes from a new chemical element. The element is there and I’ve got to find it. We are sure!”\n– Marie in writing to Bronia\n\nAt last, she found an element 150 more active that uranium. She called it polonium, after Poland. Henri Becquerel presented their report to the Academy, “On a New Radioactive Substance Contained in Pitchblende.”\nImpressed by Marie’s research, the Academy of Sciences awarded her the Gegner Prize, but because its member were male chauvinists, did not tell her.\nInstead, Pierre was asked to inform her that she had won the prize and with it, three thousand eight hundred francs. From barium, they isolated an element which was 900 more radioactive than uranium. They named this project radium. To isolate radium, they had to work with several tons of pitchblende from a mine in Jachomov (Czech Republic).\nPitchblende is one of the most complex minerals, containing up to 30 different elements, combined in a great variety of ways. In addition, the Curies were not trained chemists – yet they were not discouraged.\n\n\n8.4.11 Finding Actinium\nWhile working on pitchblende in 1899, André-Louis Debierne discovered actinium, a rare, highly radioactive silvery-white metal that also glowed blue in the dark.\nScientists began to notice the effects of radioactive material. They gave a glass tube of radioactive barium to Becquerel, who kept it in his waistcoat for about six hours. This caused a burn on his skin the shape of the glass tube. Yet he felt no burning sensation.\nWhen young chemist Bertrand Goldschmidt arrived for an interview in June 1933, she told him in a strong Polish accent, ‘for a year or two, you will be my slave in chemistry and do everything for me’.\nHe was in awe of this ‘rather small old lady with big hairs on her chin, who looked much older than her sixty-five years’.\nHe was fascinated by the stories still circulating of a once-active love-life. There were ‘many rumours’, including that Eve Curie, born in 1904, and with her blue eyes and dark hair so different from her older, fairer sister, was not Pierre Curie’s daughter, ‘but André Debierne’s’.\n\n\n8.4.12 Dangers of Radioactivity\n\n“If one leaves a small glass ampulla with several centigrams of radium salt in one’s pocket for a few hours, one will feel absolutely nothing. But in 15 days afterwards redness will appear on the epidermis, and then a sore, which will be very difficult to heal. A more prolonged action could lead to paralysis and death.”\n– Pierre Curie in his Nobel Prize Lecture\n\nPierre personally confirmed the possibly dangerous effect by intentionally inducing a burn on his own arm with radioactive barium. It took fifty-two days to heal, leaving a gray spot he believed indicated a deeper injury. Both he and Marie had already noticed that handling containers of radioactive material caused their fingertips to become hard and painful for as long as two months. It was clear that radium was a health hazard.\nDoctors started to experiment with radium. It reduced their patients’ tumours, lesions, and some kinds of cancer. This radium treatment became known as Curie-therapy."
